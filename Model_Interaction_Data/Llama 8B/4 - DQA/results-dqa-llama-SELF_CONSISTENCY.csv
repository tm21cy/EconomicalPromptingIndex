The pronoun ""he"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is the ""patient"". Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is:

(A) The patient

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the pronoun: The pronoun in this sentence is ""he"".
2. Identify the sentence structure: The sentence is ""The patient was referred to the specialist because [dependent clause]"". This implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the patient's skin condition and the referral.
3. Consider the pronoun's referring potential: Given the sentence structure, it's likely that ""he"" is referring to the patient, as the patient is the one who had a skin condition (according to the given sentence).

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""The patient was referred to the specialist because..."": This clause sets up the reason for the referral.
* ""...he had a rare skin condition"": This is the reason given for the referral.

The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence is referring to the patient, not the specialist. The sentence structure implies that the patient is the one who has the rare skin condition.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is ""The scientist collaborated with the artist, and he shared a story.""

The pronoun is ""he"". To find the antecedent, we need to look back to the previous nouns in the sentence to see which one ""he"" refers to.

The previous nouns are ""scientist"" and ""artist"". Therefore, ""he"" likely refers to one of these two, but we can't be certain which one without more context.

Final Answer = (C)
Let's break down the sentence:

""The scientist collaborated with the artist, and he shared a story.""

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to the subject of the sentence that did the action ""shared a story"". The subject of the sentence is the one that did the action.

""The scientist"" and ""the artist"" are the two possible subjects, but only one of them can be the one who shared the story.

So, let's look at the verb ""collaborated"" - it tells us that ""The scientist"" and ""the artist"" worked together. Since they collaborated, it's likely that one of them did the action ""shared a story"".

But the sentence doesn't specify which one, so we can't determine for sure which one it is.

Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer = (C)
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The scientist collaborated with the artist, and he shared a story.""

The pronoun ""he"" appears at the end of the sentence, and we need to find its antecedent, which is the word that it refers to.

The first noun in the sentence is ""scientist"", and the second noun is ""artist"". The sentence is connected by the conjunction ""and"", which indicates that the two actions are happening concurrently.

The action described by the verb ""shared"" is happening concurrently with the collaboration, and since ""he"" is the subject of ""shared"", it must be referring to one of the two nouns.

Given that the collaboration is listed first, it's likely that the pronoun ""he"" is referring to the scientist, as the starting sentence element is ""The scientist collaborated with the artist"".

The sentence is: ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because she used big words.""

The pronoun ""she"" is the one we're looking at.

The phrase ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer"" sets up a relationship between the developer and the writer, but it doesn't directly mention ""she"" being the one using big words.

The phrase ""because she used big words"" tells us that ""she"" is the one responsible for using big words. But we need to figure out who ""she"" refers to.

The options are:

(A) The developer uses big words
(B) The writer uses big words
(C) Ambiguous

Looking at the sentence, it's clear that the developer is trying to communicate with the writer, but they're unable to because the writer is using big words. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" refers to the writer, not the developer.

Final Answer ((B))
Let's break it down step by step!

* The sentence is ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because she used big words.""
* The pronoun ""she"" refers to the person who used big words.
* The question is, who used big words?
* The options are: the developer, the writer, or both?
* The text tells us that the developer was unable to communicate with the writer, but it doesn't say anything about the developer using big words.
* Therefore, the most likely answer is that the writer used big words, as the sentence implies that the reason for the developer's inability to communicate is that the writer is using big words that the developer can't understand.

Final Answer(((B))).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because she used big words.""

The pronoun is ""she"". 

The pronoun ""she"" refers to the person who used big words, which is likely either the developer or the writer. 

Therefore, both options (A) and (B) are possible antecedents, making the sentence ambiguous.

* The sentence has two nouns: ""scientist"" and ""artist"".

* The verb ""share"" is connected to the clause ""he will share a story"", which is a separate clause from the clause ""The scientist will collaborate with the artist"".
* Since the noun ""scientist"" is the one performing the action of collaborating, it is more likely that the pronoun ""he"" refers to the ""scientist"".
* Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the ""scientist"".

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The scientist will collaborate with the artist, and he will share a story.""

The pronoun ""he"" is the one we need to find the antecedent for.

The possible antecedents are:

* ""the scientist""
* ""the artist""

The sentence doesn't explicitly specify which one ""he"" refers to. The word ""and"" connects the two clauses, implying that the collaboration is followed by the sharing of a story, but it doesn't clarify who is doing the sharing.

Therefore, I conclude that:

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The scientist will collaborate with the artist, and he will share a story.""

The pronoun ""he"" appears at the end of the sentence, and we need to determine what it refers to.

The two options that ""he"" could refer to are the scientist and the artist. Both of them are mentioned earlier in the sentence.

The order in which they appear does not provide a clear indication of which one ""he"" refers to. Therefore, the antecedent of ""he"" is ambiguous.

Since the sentence doesn't provide more context to disambiguate the intended antecedent, it's ambiguous between Bailey's office and the director's office.

Final Answer ((C))
Let's break it down:

* The sentence is ""Bailey planned to meet the director at their office""
* The pronoun is ""their"", which is referring to a noun.

The logical options are:

* (A) The office was the director's office: This would make sense because the director would likely be the one who has an office.
* (B) The office was Bailey's office: This is also possible because Bailey might have a shared office with the director.
* (C) Ambiguous: This is also a possibility because the sentence doesn't provide enough information to determine who's office it is.

After careful consideration, we can conclude that there is no definitive answer. It could be either Bailey's office or the director's office.

Final Answer = (C).
Let's break it down:

* The sentence is ""Bailey planned to meet the director at their office"".
* The pronoun is ""their"".
* The antecedent is the noun phrase that the pronoun replaces.
* In this case, the possible antecedents are ""Bailey"", ""the director"", or ""office"".

However, in this sentence, it is most likely that ""their"" refers to the director, as it is more common for the director to have an office, rather than Bailey. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ""the director"".

The phrase ""she liked the design"" must be referring to one of the two individuals mentioned in the sentence: the developer or the designer. However, there is no additional information to disambiguate the pronoun, making it unclear which one ""she"" refers to.

Therefore, I conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The developer argued with the designer because she liked the design.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun 'she', we need to look for the noun or pronoun that it refers to. In this case, the pronoun 'she' is in a subordinate clause (because she liked the design), which is introduced by the subordinate conjunction 'because'.

The pronoun 'she' refers back to the subject of the subordinate clause, which is not the developer (the main subject of the sentence), but rather another person who is the object of the liking. This person is not mentioned explicitly in the sentence, but it is implied to be the designer.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((B))
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The developer argued with the designer because she liked the design.""

The pronoun is ""she"".

What is ""she"" referring to in this sentence?

* It's not referring to the developer, because it's the developer who is arguing (subject-verb agreement: ""the developer argued"").
* It's not referring to the designer, because it's the designer who is being argued with (object of the preposition ""with"").

So, what could it be referring to?

Hmm... The only remaining option is...

...the developer or the designer could both be female, making it ambiguous!

""The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but she was too late.""

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to the subject of the sentence ""was too late"". Since ""the investigator"" is a singular subject, it cannot fit the description of ""she"". Additionally, ""the investigator"" is the intended performer of the action of ""interview"", making it even less likely to be the one described as ""too late"".

On the other hand, ""the witness"" is the intended recipient of the interview, which suggests a possibility that the witness may be the one who is too late. Although this connection is not explicitly stated, it seems more plausible than the investigator being too late.

Therefore, I believe the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is more likely to be the witness than the investigator.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

In the sentence, the pronoun ""she"" refers to the noun that came immediately before it. In this case, the noun is ""The witness"".

So, ""she"" refers to ""The witness"", meaning that ""The witness was too late"".

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence and identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"".

The sentence is: ""The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but she was too late.""

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to the subject of the sentence that is not the investigator. The options are the investigator and the witness.

The sentence is: ""The guard called the cleaner and asked them to open the door.""

The pronoun is ""them"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify the noun or pronoun that ""them"" refers to in the sentence.

The sentence has two main entities: ""the guard"" and ""the cleaner"". The verb ""called"" is followed by ""the cleaner"", which suggests that ""the cleaner"" is the one being called, not ""the guard"".

The verb ""asked"" is the one that is relevant to finding the antecedent of ""them"". The sentence says ""asked them"", which means ""them"" is the object of the verb ""asked"".

Since ""the guard"" is not the one being asked, it's likely that ""the cleaner"" is the one being asked. Therefore, the antecedent of ""them"" is ""the cleaner"".

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down.

The sentence is: ""The guard called the cleaner and asked them to open the door.""

The pronoun is ""them"".

We need to identify what ""them"" refers to.

The sentence states ""The guard called the cleaner..."" which means the guard is the one performing the action of calling.

The next part of the sentence is ""and asked them to open the door"". This implies that the cleaner is the one being asked to open the door.

In this context, ""them"" refers to the cleaner, not the guard.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The guard called the cleaner and asked them to open the door.""

The pronoun is ""them"", which refers to the object of the verb ""asked"".

The object of the verb ""asked"" is the indirect object, which is ""them"".

Now, let's look at the options:

(A) ""Asked the guard"" would be incorrect because the guard is the one doing the asking, not the one being asked.

(B) ""Asked the cleaner"" would be incorrect because the cleaner is the one being asked, not the one doing the asking.

(C) Ambiguous is not correct because ""the guard called the cleaner"" clearly indicates that the guard is the one doing the action, and ""them"" refers to the cleaner.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"" is the cleaner.

The sentence is: ""The scientist collaborates with the artist, and he shares a story.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"", we need to look back in the sentence to see what word it refers to. Our options are the scientist and the artist, since they are the only nouns mentioned in the sentence.

Since the sentence is ""The scientist collaborates with the artist, and he shares a story"", the pronoun ""he"" is clearly referring back to one of these two nouns.

The word ""collaborates"" is a shared action between the scientist and the artist, indicating a joint activity. This implies that the pronoun ""he"" is referring to the entity performing the action along with the scientist, which is the artist.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down!

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the subject of the sentence. The sentence has two main clauses joined by ""and"". The first clause is ""The scientist collaborates with the artist"", and the second clause is ""and he shares a story"".

The subject of the first clause is ""The scientist"", and the subject of the second clause is ""he"" (since it's implied by the verb ""shares""). Since ""he"" is not explicitly mentioned in the first clause, we look for a suitable antecedent within the same sentence.

In this case, the closest noun to ""he"" is ""the artist"", but the sentence doesn't explicitly state that the artist shares the story. The sentence doesn't provide enough information to clearly identify the one who shares the story. Therefore, the antecedent of ""he"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = (C)
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The scientist collaborates with the artist, and he shares a story.""

First, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

The sentence describes two entities: the scientist and the artist. The pronoun ""he"" could refer to either one of them.

Since the sentence states that the scientist collaborates with the artist, we can infer that one of them is doing something after collaborating. However, the sentence doesn't specify which one is doing the sharing.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either the scientist or the artist.

* The sentence mentions two entities: the customer and the chef.
* The sentence states that they discuss something (his culinary training).
* The pronoun ""his"" refers to the owner of the culinary training.

Now, let's analyze the options:

* (A) It is the customer's culinary training: This option seems unlikely because the customer is likely not the one with culinary training. Customers are typically not trained in cooking.
* (B) It is the chef's culinary training: This option makes more sense because chefs are typically trained in cooking and would have culinary training.
* (C) Ambiguous: While we can make a logical inference that the culinary training belongs to the chef, technically, it's not specified in the sentence, so it could be ambiguous if we didn't have any additional context.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The customer and the chef discuss his culinary training.""

The pronoun ""his"" refers to the entity that has undergone culinary training. We need to identify who or what that entity is.

In English, possession is typically marked by using the possessive adjective ""his"", ""her"", or ""its"" corresponding to the antecedent (the noun that the pronoun refers to). Since we don't have any clear indication of gender or a third-person singular neuter pronoun, we can assume the chef is the more likely candidate to have undergone culinary training. Chefs typically have culinary training, and customers might not necessarily have it (although this is not a hard and fast rule!).

Therefore, the antecedent of ""his"" is likely the chef's culinary training.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The customer and the chef discuss his culinary training.""

The pronoun ""his"" is referring to a noun that has already been mentioned in the sentence. The possible options are:

* The customer
* The chef

Since ""the customer"" is a male or neutral noun (it could be a guy or a person of any gender), and the chef is also a male noun (a he/she), the sentence is ambiguous.

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the entity that is being described as ""arrogant"". The sentence structure suggests that the phrase ""because he is arrogant"" is describing why the mechanic dislikes the cashier.

The word ""he"" refers back to the noun phrase ""the mechanic"" or ""the cashier"", but only one of them is described as being arrogant. Since the mechanic is not described as arrogant, the pronoun ""he"" must refer to the cashier.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = (B)
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The mechanic disliked the cashier because he is arrogant.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

To find the antecedent, we need to ask ourselves who or what ""he"" refers to.

The sentence has two nouns: ""mechanic"" and ""cashier"". These are the two potential antecedents of the pronoun ""he"".

The sentence structure suggests that the mechanic is doing the disliking, and the reason for disliking is because of something about the cashier. Therefore, it is more likely that ""he"" refers to the cashier, who is being described as arrogant.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to the person who is described as ""the mechanic"" or ""the cashier"". 

We need to find the noun that the pronoun ""he"" is replacing. 

In the sentence, ""the mechanic"" is a noun phrase and ""the cashier"" is also a noun phrase. 

The verb ""disliked"" is linked to the first noun phrase ""the mechanic"", indicating that the mechanic is the one who is doing the disliking. 

So, the pronoun ""he"" is referring to the mechanic, because the mechanic is the subject of the sentence.

The pronoun is ""his"", which refers to the antecedent (the thing it is replacing).

The candidates are:

(A) The office was the director's office
(B) The office was Bailey's office

The antecedent of ""his"" is the person it belongs to, which is either the director or Bailey. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine which one is the owner of the office, so it is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""Bailey planned to meet the director at his office""

The pronoun is ""his"".

The pronoun ""his"" is referring to the person who is going to be met by Bailey. In other words, it is referring to the director.

Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""This story could not be published without the writer and their friends' support.""

The pronoun is ""their"". The question is what does ""their"" refer to?

""a friend"" or ""the writer""?

In this case, it's clear that ""their"" refers back to ""the writer's"", so ""their"" is possessive, indicating that the friends belong to the writer.

""The chief thanked the housekeeper and gave her some tips.""

* ""The chief"" is a noun phrase that refers to a person, the subject of the sentence.
* ""thanked the housekeeper"" is a verb phrase that describes the chief's action. The housekeeper is the direct object of this verb phrase.
* ""and"" is a coordinating conjunction that connects the two independent clauses.
* ""gave her some tips"" is another verb phrase that describes the chief's action. The subject of this verb phrase is not explicitly stated, but the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is likely the object of the previous verb phrase, ""the housekeeper"".

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the housekeeper.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

* ""The chief thanked the housekeeper..."" -> The chief is the subject that performed the action of thanking.
* ""...and gave her some tips."" -> The verb ""gave"" is continued from the previous clause, and the pronoun ""her"" is referring to the object of the previous clause.

The antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the ""housekeeper"", because we know that the chief is thanking the housekeeper and giving something to her.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down!

* ""The chief thanked the housekeeper"" implies that the chief is the one doing the thanking.
* ""and gave her some tips"" follows the verb ""thanked"", and ""her"" seems to refer to the same person being thanked (the housekeeper).

So, ""her"" in the sentence refers to the housekeeper.

""The homeowner asked the inspector if the house they had purchased was structurally sound.""

* The sentence mentions ""they"" which is a pronoun.
* Before determining the antecedent of the pronoun, we need to consider the possible antecedents: ""the homeowner"" and ""the inspector"".

The sentence implies that the inspector is evaluating the house, but it doesn't specify who purchased the house. Therefore, it is ambiguous whether the pronoun ""they"" refers to the homeowner or the inspector.

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

* The sentence is: ""The homeowner asked the inspector if the house they had purchased was structurally sound.""
* The pronoun is ""they"".
* The question is who performed the action of ""purchased"". 

Therefore, ""they"" refers to the person who performed the action of ""purchased"", which is the homeowner. This is because ""the house they had purchased"" is the object of the question, and the agent performing the action of ""purchased"" is the same person who is asking the question, which is the homeowner.

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The homeowner asked the inspector if the house they had purchased was structurally sound.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

Who had purchased the house?

The sentence states ""they had purchased"", but who are ""they""?

The antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the one who had purchased the house.

Since ""the inspector"" is not the one who purchased the house, we can eliminate option (B).

Option (A) ""The homeowner had purchased"" is the correct antecedent, as it matches the fact that the sentence states ""the homeowner asked..."". The homeowner is the one who purchased the house.

* ""...because he focuses on code.""
	+ The pronoun ""he"" refers to one of the individuals.

Now, the question is which one of the individuals, the developer or the writer, does the pronoun ""he"" refer to?

Based on the sentence structure, it seems more likely that ""he"" refers to ""the writer"" because the sentence is saying that the writer's focus on code is the reason why communication with the writer is impossible.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because he focuses on code.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

To find the antecedent, we need to identify the noun that ""he"" refers to. In this sentence, the two nouns are ""developer"" and ""writer"".

The sentence structure indicates that ""because"" is introducing a reason for why the developer was unable to communicate with the writer. Therefore, it's likely that ""he"" refers to the one who is doing the focusing, to provide the reason for the inability to communicate.

Given these points, it's clear that ""he"" refers to the ""writer"" (option B), as the writer is the one who focuses on code, making it the reason for the inability to communicate.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the person who is unable to communicate with the writer, which is either the developer or the writer. The sentence is saying that the developer was unable to communicate with the writer because of a reason related to the writer, which is that the writer focuses on code.

The part of the sentence ""he focuses on code"" is the one that determines the antecedent of ""he"". Since the subject of ""focuses on code"" is ""he"", and ""he"" is the one who is unable to communicate with the writer, it means that the writer is the one who focuses on code, not the developer.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).

The sentence is saying that the supervisor gave the employee feedback on something related to him. The phrase ""his stellar performance"" implies that the feedback is about the employee's performance, because ""his"" refers to a masculine possessor, which is the employee in this case. 

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is (B) It was the employee's performance.

Final Answer ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence.

The pronoun ""his"" refers to the person or thing that the previous noun is describing. In this sentence, the previous noun is ""employee"", which is a singular noun and a male noun (since ""his"" is used). 

So, logically, ""his"" refers to the employee's performance. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is the employee's performance.

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The supervisor gave the employee feedback on his stellar performance.""

The pronoun is ""his"". To find the antecedent of the pronoun, we need to look for the noun that ""his"" refers to.

The nouns in the sentence are:

* supervisor
* employee
* performance

Which of these nouns is modified by ""his""?

The word ""stellar"" is an adjective modifying the noun ""performance"". Therefore, ""his"" must refer to the one who has the stellar performance, which is the employee.

The sentence is: ""The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because he needed to understand the case.""

The pronoun is ""he"". To find its antecedent, we need to look back at the sentence and see what it refers to.

The words ""the lawyer"" are the subject of the sentence, but they don't match the pronoun ""he"". The pronoun ""he"" doesn't seem to refer to ""the lawyer"" directly.

Then, we look at ""the cashier"", but it doesn't match either. ""He"" doesn't seem to refer to ""the cashier"" directly either.

So, we have to conclude that the antecedent is not clearly stated in the sentence, making it ambiguous.

Final Answer = (C)
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because he needed to understand the case.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

The question is: What antecedent does ""he"" refer to?

The options are: (A) The lawyer, (B) The cashier, (C) Ambiguous.

To determine the antecedent, we need to examine the sentence structure and the context. The sentence starts with ""The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier"", which tells us that the lawyer is the one investigating the accusations.

The word ""because"" introduces a reason for the action, which is ""he needed to understand the case"". The antecedent of ""he"" is the one who needs to understand the case, and that is the lawyer.

Therefore, the correct answer is: Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because he needed to understand the case.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

The subject of the sentence is ""The lawyer"". The verb ""looked"" refers to the lawyer.

The part of the sentence that introduces the pronoun is ""because he needed to understand the case"".

So, ""he"" can only refer to the person who is doing the needing, which is the one who initiated the action of looking (based on the word order and the verb ""needed"" indicating a purpose).

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the lawyer.

""The mechanic called to inform the customer that his car would be ready in the morning.""

The pronoun ""his"" refers to the possessor of the car. There are two possible referents:

1. The mechanic could be the possessor of the car, implying that it's the mechanic's car.
2. The customer could be the possessor of the car, implying that it's the customer's car.

Since the sentence does not provide clear context or additional information, it can't be definitively determined which option is correct. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's break it down.

The sentence is: The mechanic called to inform the customer that his car would be ready in the morning.

The pronoun is ""his"".

To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun or phrase that the pronoun refers to. In this case, ""his"" is attached to ""car"", so we need to identify the owner of the car.

The sentence mentions the mechanic and the customer, but it doesn't mention the words ""mechanic's"" or ""customer's"". However, we can infer that the mechanic is calling about the customer's car, as the mechanic is working on the car and informing the customer about its status.

So, the antecedent of ""his"" is likely the customer's car.
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence reads: ""The mechanic called to inform the customer that his car would be ready in the morning.""

The pronoun is ""his"", and we need to determine what it refers to.

We know that ""his"" is a possessive adjective modifying the noun ""car"". This means ""his"" indicates that the car belongs to someone.

The two candidates for the owner of the car are:

1. The mechanic
2. The customer

Now, let's consider the context. The sentence is talking about a car that needs to be repaired. It's natural that the car is the customer's car, not the mechanic's. Mechanics don't normally have their own cars being repaired!

With this context in mind, it's clear that ""his"" refers to the customer's car. Therefore:

The sentence is: ""The worker told the pedestrian that they were repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

The question is: What is the antecedent of the pronoun ""they""?

We have two nouns: ""worker"" and ""pedestrian"".

 Neither ""worker"" nor ""pedestrian"" is probable to be the antecedent of ""they"", because ""worker"" is the one performing the action of ""telling"", and ""pedestrian"" is the one receiving the information.

So, there is no clear antecedent for the pronoun ""they"". The sentence structure does not provide sufficient information to determine the referent of the pronoun.

Therefore, I conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is:

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break it down step by step!

In the sentence ""The worker told the pedestrian that they were repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible,"" the pronoun ""they"" is referring to...

The subject of the subordinate clause is ""they"", and in the subordinate clause, ""they"" is performing the action of ""repairing"". So, the antecedent of ""they"" is... 

The thing that is performing the action of ""repairing"" is... the worker! The pedestrian wasn't repairing anything, they were just receiving the information. Therefore, the correct answer is...

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The worker told the pedestrian that they were repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

The subject of the sentence is ""the worker"", and the verb is ""told"". The object of the sentence is the pedestrian.

The pronoun ""they"" appears in the subordinate clause ""that they were repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible"". This clause is describing the content of the message being conveyed by the worker.

Since both ""the taxpayer"" and ""the accountant"" are entities that can help with tax preparation, it is ambiguous which one is being referred to by the pronoun ""they"".

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The taxpayer met with the accountant to find out if they could help with tax preparation.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

To determine the antecedent of ""they"", we need to look at the sentence and see what it refers to.

The word ""they"" is in the clause ""if they could help"", which is a condition (i.e., a hypothetical situation) that the taxpayer wants to find out about.

The closest noun to ""they"" is ""accountant"", but the accountant is not the one who can help with tax preparation. The sentence implies that it's the accountant who can help, but the one who can help is the subject of the condition (""if they could help"").

Furthermore, it's unlikely that the taxpayer can help with tax preparation, as the sentence implies that the taxpayer needs help, not can help others.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""they"" is the accountant.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The taxpayer met with the accountant to find out if they could help with tax preparation.""

1. Identify the pronoun: ""they""
2. Check if the pronoun is singular or plural: ""they"" is a plural pronoun.
3. Look for the antecedent: The antecedent must be a singular or plural noun that the pronoun refers to.

In this case, the antecedent is ""accountant"". The accountant is also a singular noun. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is ""accountant"".

The sentence is: ""The developer argued with the designer because he liked the design.""

The pronoun is ""he"". 

The question is: What person is ""he"" referring to in the sentence?

The sentence is structured as ""because he liked the design"", which means that ""he"" is the one performing the action of liking the design.

The phrase ""The developer argued with the designer"" suggests that the developer and the designer are the two main entities involved in this situation. 

Because of this, it's more natural to assume that ""he"" is referring to the developer, implying that the developer liked the design. 

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is:

(B) The designer liked the design does not make sense in the context of the sentence.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""The developer argued with the designer"" - this sets up a conflict between the developer and the designer.
* ""because"" - this indicates the reason for the argument.
* ""he liked the design"" - this is the reason for the argument.

The pronoun ""he"" introduces the antecedent, which refers to the person who liked the design. The question is, who is that person?

Both the developer and the designer are involved in the conflict, but the sentence only tells us that the developer argued with the designer. It doesn't explicitly state who liked the design.

In a typical sentence, the pronoun would refer to the most recent noun mentioned before it. In this case, the most recent nouns are ""the developer"" and ""the designer"". Based on the sentence structure, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to the developer, as the developer is the one who argued with the designer.

However, it's not entirely clear-cut, and some might argue that ""he"" could still refer to the designer. Therefore, I would say that the answer is:

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The developer argued with the designer because he liked the design.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

The word ""he"" needs an antecedent, which is a noun or a pronoun that it refers to.

The options are:

* (A) ""The developer""
* (B) ""The designer""

Let's analyze the sentence:

* We are told that ""he"" liked the design. This indicates that the one who liked the design is a party involved in the argument.
* The developer and the designer are the two parties involved in the argument.
* Since the developer argued with the designer, it's likely that the one who liked the design is either the developer or the designer.

However, the sentence doesn't explicitly state which one liked the design. It only tells us that the argument was because of the design.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""he"" is ambiguous between the developer and the designer.

The pronoun is ""they"", and it refers to something that likes to teach others.

The options claim that the pronoun refers to either the cook or the assistant. However, the sentence structure suggests that the antecedent is the subject-cause of the because-clause, which is ""the cook"".

The cook is the one doing the teaching, and it's likely that the cook likes to teach others. The assistant is receiving the teaching, not doing the teaching.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((A)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The cook is always teaching the assistant new techniques because they like to teach others.""

The pronoun ""they"" refers to the group or entity that is performing the action of liking to teach others. To determine who this entity is, we need to look for the verb phrase that precedes the pronoun.

The verb phrase is ""like to teach others"". There are two nouns in the sentence: ""the cook"" and ""the assistant"". Neither of these nouns performs the action of ""liking to teach others"", as these are the subjects of the sentence, not the agents performing the action.

The phrase ""they like to teach others"" can be interpreted as an impersonal construction, indicating a general tendency or inclination to teach others. In this case, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either the cook, the assistant, or even a third party not mentioned in the sentence.

Final Answer = (C).
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""they"" is the pronoun
* ""they"" is referring to the subject of the sentence, which is either the cook or the assistant

Since neither the verb ""is always teaching"" nor the verb ""like"" modifying ""they"" is the main verb of the sentence, we need to look at the clause as a whole.

The sentence says ""the cook is always teaching the assistant new techniques because [they] like to teach others"". This implies that the cook is motivated to teach the assistant because they (the cook) enjoy teaching others. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the cook.

The antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the closest noun phrase, which is ""the specialist"". It is referring to the specialist because the sentence says ""he is an expert on rare skin conditions"".

So, the final answer is:
Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence.

* ""The patient was referred to the specialist"" - This part of the sentence sets up the context. We have a patient and a specialist.
* ""because"" - This is a subordinating conjunction introducing a clause that explains why the patient was referred.
* ""he is an expert on rare skin conditions"" - This is the clause explaining why the patient was referred.

The pronoun ""he"" is the one in question. It's referring to someone mentioned in the sentence. Who could it be?

Clearly, it's referring to the specialist, since the specialist is the one who is an expert on rare skin conditions.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step!

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to someone in the sentence. In this case, the options are the patient or the specialist.

The sentence says ""the patient was referred to the specialist"", which means the patient is the one being referred. Then it says ""because he is an expert on rare skin conditions"".

To find the antecedent of the pronoun, we need to identify the noun that the pronoun refers to. In this sentence, ""she"" is the object of the clause ""that ... had completed the repair"", which means it's referring to the subject of the clause ""had completed the repair"".

The subject of the clause ""had completed the repair"" is the one who performed the action of completing the repair.

Now, let's look at the sentence again: ""The technician told the customer that she had completed the repair.""

The customer is the recipient of the information, but they are not the one who performed the action of completing the repair.

On the other hand, the technician is the one who told the customer the information, but they are not the one who completed the repair (otherwise, it would be redundant).

So, the only option left is that the one who completed the repair is the technician herself. The sentence is saying that the technician told the customer that she (the technician) had completed the repair.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Let's break down the sentence:

""The technician told the customer that she had completed the repair.""

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to the subject of the clause ""had completed the repair"". The subject of this clause is either the technician or the customer.

Option (A) ""The technician completed the repair"" is not likely, as the technician is the one telling the customer about the repair, not the one who completed the repair.

Option (B) ""The customer completed the repair"" is also not likely, as the customer is the one being told about the repair, not the one who completed it.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ambiguous. It could refer to either the technician or the customer, because both could be the one who completed the repair.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The technician told the customer that she had completed the repair.""

The pronoun is ""she"". To find the antecedent of ""she"", we need to look for the noun that it refers to.

The noun ""technician"" is not an option because it is a masculine noun, whereas ""she"" is a feminine pronoun.

The noun ""customer"" is not an option either because it is a plural noun, whereas ""she"" refers to a singular entity.

After re-reading the sentence, I realize that ""technician"" is not the correct antecedent, and neither is ""customer"".

The correct antecedent is... the subject of the subordinate clause ""that""!

The sentence can be rephrased as: ""The technician told the customer that the authorized person (the technician) had completed the repair.""

""The secretary corrected the developer because they better understood the problem.""

The pronoun is ""they"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify the noun that ""they"" replaces.

The closest noun to the pronoun is ""the developer"", but it's unlikely that the sentence means the developer did something that they understood.

A more plausible option is that ""they"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is ""the secretary"". However, this is not explicitly stated in the sentence.

Therefore, I conclude that the antecedent of ""they"" is ambiguous. 

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The secretary corrected the developer because they better understood the problem.""

The pronoun is ""they"". The word ""because"" introduces the reason for the secretary correcting the developer.

The phrase ""they better understood the problem"" is a dependent clause, and it is describing the entity that is the reason for the correction. Therefore, ""they"" must refer to the entity that has a better understanding of the problem.

The options are:

A. The secretary understood the problem: This would mean that the secretary corrected the developer because the secretary themselves had a better understanding of the problem, but the sentence doesn't imply that the secretary has a better understanding, it only implies that the person who corrected has a better understanding.

B. The developer understood the problem: This is a possible interpretation, it means that the developer corrected the developer because the developer themselves had a better understanding of the problem, which is a logical connection.

C. Ambiguous: This option could be true if the sentence didn't provide any additional context or information. However, in this case, we can rely on the structure of the sentence and the verb ""corrected"" which suggests a more powerful entity (the secretary) doing the correcting to the developer, which makes B more plausible than A.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The secretary corrected the developer because they better understood the problem.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

To identify the antecedent, we need to find the noun or pronoun that the pronoun refers to.

The two possible candidates are ""the secretary"" and ""the developer"".

Since ""the secretary"" performed the action of correcting, it's unlikely that ""they"" refers to the secretary. The secretary is more likely to be the one who understood, but performed the correction.

On the other hand, ""the developer"" is a likely candidate to be ""they"", as they are the one who is supposed to have a better understanding of the problem.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is ""the developer"".

1. Identify the pronoun: The pronoun is ""he"".
2. Determine the noun forms in the sentence: We have ""undergraduate"" and ""scientist"".
3. Find the sentence structure: The sentence is structured as ""Because-clause"" with an antecedent located outside the clause.

Considering the sentence structure, we can deduce that the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the closest noun from outside the ""because-clause"", which is ""undergraduate"".

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

* ""The undergraduate"" is a noun phrase that introduces a subject.
* ""applied to work with the scientist"" is a clause that describes the action of the subject.
* ""because"" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a subordinate clause.
* ""he needed a lab assistant"" is the subordinate clause, which provides the reason for the action in the main clause.

Now, let's focus on the pronoun ""he"". It refers to...

* The subject of the sentence is ""the undergraduate"", so ""he"" can only refer to the undergraduate.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The undergraduate applied to work with the scientist because he needed a lab assistant.""

The pronoun is ""he"", and we need to find its antecedent.

The options are:

(A) The undergraduate needed an assistant
(B) The scientist needed an assistant
(C) Ambiguous

The word ""he"" is referring back to the subject of the sentence, which is ""the undergraduate"". The reason for this is that the undergraduate is the one performing the action of applying to work with the scientist, and the reason for this action is that the undergraduate needed a lab assistant.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is indeed the undergraduate.

* The pronoun is ""their"".
* To find the antecedent of the pronoun, we need to identify what ""their"" refers to.
* In this sentence, ""stellar performance"" is the object of the prepositional phrase ""on their stellar performance"".
* The sentence is telling us that the supervisor gave the employee feedback about something, and that something is their stellar performance.
* The antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is ""employee"", as they are the ones who had a stellar performance.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down.

The sentence is ""The supervisor gave the employee feedback on their stellar performance.""

The pronoun is ""their"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify which noun it refers to.

The options are:

* (A) ""It was the supervisor's performance""
* (B) ""It was the employee's performance""
* (C) ""Ambiguous""

Let's analyze the sentence. The subject of the sentence is ""the supervisor"", and the feedback is given to ""the employee"". The feedback is about something related to the employee (their performance), but it's not about the supervisor's performance. Therefore, the correct antecedent is the employee's performance.

So, the answer is:
Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence step by step:

* The sentence is: ""The supervisor gave the employee feedback on their stellar performance.""
* The phrase ""their stellar performance"" is referring to the quality or outcome being discussed.
* The owner of this quality or outcome is the employee, as indicated by the phrase ""the employee"".

The sentence is: ""The salesperson tried to fool the writer and sold them some garbage.""

Here, ""them"" is the pronoun we're interested in.

The sentence mentions ""the salesperson"" and ""the writer"". Both are potential subjects.

Now, let's look at the verb ""sold"". The subject of ""sold"" is ""them"". Who is ""them""?

Since ""the salesperson"" is the one trying to fool someone, it's possible that ""them"" refers to ""the writer"". After all, the salesperson is trying to sell garbage to the writer.

On the other hand, could ""them"" refer to ""the salesperson""? No, because the sentence says the salesperson is trying to fool the writer, implying a separation between the two.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"" is most naturally taken as ""the writer"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

""The salesperson tried to fool the writer and sold them some garbage.""

* ""them"" is the pronoun
* ""try to fool"" is an action performed by ""the salesperson""
* ""sold"" is also an action performed by ""the salesperson""
* ""the writer"" is the object being fooled and potentially misdifferentiating the subject of the next action
* ""to them"" (direct object of ""sold"") indicates that ""them"" is referring to the indirect object of ""fool"" (i.e., the one being fooled)
* Since ""the writer"" is being fooled, ""them"" likely refers back to ""the writer"", rather than ""the salesperson"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The salesperson tried to fool the writer and sold them some garbage.""

The pronoun is ""them"".

To find the antecedent, we need to identify what ""them"" refers to. The sentence mentions two individuals: the salesperson and the writer.

The word ""and"" implies that both the salesperson and the writer are involved in the action of being sold something.

The sentence structure suggests that ""them"" is a direct object, which means it refers to the person or people receiving the action of being sold something.

Considering the sentence structure and the meaning, ""them"" likely refers to the writer. The writer is the one being fooled, and it is likely that they are the one being sold some garbage as well.

The sentence states ""The driver yelled at the tailor after he broke a window"".

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to someone who did an action, but which action? And who did it?

We know that the driver yelled at the tailor, but we don't know who broke the window. It could be the driver or the tailor.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The driver yelled at the tailor after he broke a window.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

To find the antecedent, we need to identify what ""he"" refers to. The options are:

* The driver
* The tailor

The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" should refer to the person who broke a window, as the sentence is describing the consequence of that action (being yelled at).

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is actually the person who broke a window.

Since neither ""The driver"" nor ""The tailor"" explicitly broke a window in the sentence, we cannot directly assign the pronoun to either of them.

Final Answer = (C).
To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"", we need to identify the subject performing the action of breaking a window. The sentence states ""after he broke a window"", which indicates that the subject performing the action of breaking a window is a male entity.

The original sentence does not provide a clear subject performing the action of yelling at the tailor, but it's mentioned that the driver yelled at the tailor. Since the driver is a male entity and ""he"" refers to the subject performing the action, it's more likely that the driver broke the window.

Option (B): ""The teacher liked the cake"" -> ""he"" could refer to the teacher, which is a possible scenario where the teacher is being informed that someone (the visitor) likes the cake.

Option (C): ""Ambiguous"" -> We can't pinpoint a specific antecedent without more context, as both ""the visitor"" and ""the teacher"" are candidate antecedents.

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break down the sentence step by step:

* ""The visitor"" is a noun phrase,
* ""told"" is a verb,
* ""the teacher"" is a noun phrase,
* ""that"" is a conjunction introducing a dependent clause,
* ""he"" is the pronoun,
* ""liked the cake"" is a verb phrase.

Now, let's determine what ""he"" refers to:

* It cannot refer to ""the teacher"" because ""the teacher"" is the object of the verb ""told"", not the subject of the verb ""liked"".
* It can logically refer to ""the visitor"" because it's a typical subject-verb agreement in English.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is ""the visitor"".

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's find the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

The sentence is: ""The visitor told the teacher that he liked the cake.""

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to someone who liked the cake. The only options are ""the visitor"" and ""the teacher"".

Since the visitor is telling the teacher that someone likes the cake, it's more likely that the visitor is the one who likes the cake, rather than the teacher.

The sentence is: ""The scientist will collaborate with the artist, and she will share a story.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"", we need to identify the referent of the pronoun.

The pronoun ""she"" is introduced by a coordinating conjunction ""and"", which indicates that the second part of the sentence is closely related to the first part.

In the first part, ""The scientist will collaborate with the artist"", we have two individuals: a scientist and an artist.

The pronoun ""she"" could potentially refer to either of these individuals, but there is a stronger connection between ""she"" and the one who will share a story.

Since the scientist is the one who will collaborate, it's more likely that ""she"" refers to the artist.
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The scientist will collaborate with the artist, and she will share a story.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"", we need to look at the context and identify what noun or noun phrase it refers to.

The word ""she"" is a subject pronoun, and it must refer to a person performing the action ""will share a story"". In this sentence, the only two persons mentioned are ""the scientist"" and ""the artist"".

The word ""and"" is a conjunction connecting two clauses. The first clause is ""The scientist will collaborate with the artist"", and the second clause is ""she will share a story"".

Since the pronoun ""she"" doesn't have a clear antecedent within the same clause, we need to look back to the previous clause to find its antecedent. We can see that neither ""the scientist"" nor ""the artist"" is a clear candidate, as neither performs the action ""will share a story"".

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = (C)
Let's break it down step by step!

1. We're looking for the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"".
2. The sentence mentions two entities: the scientist and the artist.
3. We need to find out who is doing the sharing of the story.

Now, let's examine the options:

(A) The scientist will share a story: This doesn't fit, as it's not the scientist who's mentioned in the relative clause.

(B) The artist will share a story: This is the most likely candidate, as the sentence is saying that the artist, who is collaborating with the scientist, will share a story.

(C) Ambiguous: This option could be argued, as one could interpret ""she"" to refer to the scientist as well. However, since there's no clear evidence to support the scientist doing the sharing, I'd lean towards option (B).

* The designer showed something (the blueprint) and asked someone (him) for feedback.
* The question asks what the pronoun ""him"" refers to.

The sentence doesn't specify who the designer asked for feedback, it only shows the designer showing the blueprint. The designer is the one who initiated the action, but we don't know who the designer asked for feedback.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C)).
To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"", we need to identify the noun that the pronoun refers to.

In the sentence ""The designer showed the cook a blueprint and asked him for feedback"", the closest noun to the pronoun ""him"" is ""cook"".

The sentence does not indicate that the designer is asking for feedback, so the pronoun ""him"" logically refers to the cook.

Therefore,

Final Answer = ((B))

The sentence is: ""The designer showed the cook a blueprint and asked him for feedback.""

The pronoun is ""him"".

The options are: (A) Asked the designer, (B) Asked the cook, or (C) Ambiguous.

The phrase ""the designer showed the cook a blueprint"" tells us that the cook is the recipient of the blueprint. This implies that the designer is the one performing the action, and the cook is the one receiving the blueprint.

The sentence is: ""My parent called his secretary for more information""

The pronoun is ""his"". The question is, what does it refer to?

We know that ""my"" refers to the parent, so the parent is the possessor of the parent.

The pronoun ""his"" is in the possessive form, indicating that it refers to the possessor of the parent. The only option that fits this is (A) - ""They were my parent's secretary"". This suggests that the parent has a secretary, and the pronoun ""his"" refers to the parent, indicating that the secretary belongs to the parent.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is ""My parent called his secretary for more information"".

The pronoun is ""his"", and we need to find its antecedent.

The antecedent is the noun that the pronoun refers to.

In this sentence, the antecedent of ""his"" is ""my parent"", because ""my parent"" is typically the one who has a secretary and would therefore call someone.

So, the correct option is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down!

* ""My parent"" refers to a singular person, let's call them ""P"".
* ""His"" is a possessive pronoun that refers to someone who has a relationship with ""P"".
* ""Secretary"" is the person who receives the call.

Now, the question is: who is the secretary of?

Option (A) suggests that the secretary is P's employee, but the sentence doesn't explicitly state this. It could also be that the secretary is someone else who works for someone else, but happens to be related to P somehow.

Option (B) implies that the secretary is the secretary of someone else (not P), which is not what the sentence intends.

The antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the ""janitor"".

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise she would have to mop it all over again.""

The pronoun is ""she"". The sentence is trying to say that if the child steps on the wet floor, the janitor will have to mop it again.

The antecedent of ""she"" is the person who would be responsible for having to mop the floor again. Since the warning is given by the janitor to the child, it's likely that the person who would have to mop the floor again is the janitor, not the child.

Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer ((A)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence says ""she would have to mop it all over again"". We need to find the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"", which refers to the subject that would perform the action of mopping.

The subject that performed the action of warning the child is ""The janitor"", not the child. Therefore, it's unlikely that the janitor would have to mop.

The only other option is the child, but it doesn't make sense that the child would have to mop the floor, as they are the ones who were warned not to step on the wet floor.

The sentence has two nouns: ""developer"" and ""writer"". The developer is not focusing on code, so it's unlikely that the pronoun ""she"" is referring to the developer.

The writer, on the other hand, is the one with whom the developer is trying to communicate, and the sentence says that it's because the writer focuses on code that the developer is unable to communicate with them.

Therefore, the correct answer is that the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the writer.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because she focuses on code.""

The pronoun is ""she"", which is referring to the Subject of the subsidiary clause ""because she focuses on code"".

In this sentence, the three options are:
(A) The carpenter had been working on the house
(B) The onlooker had been working on the house
(C) Ambiguous

To determine the antecedent, let's examine the sentence:

""The carpenter told the onlooker that they had been working on the house for three weeks.""

The phrase ""that they had been working on the house for three weeks"" is a dependent clause, and it describes the action that the carpenter is telling the onlooker.

The word ""they"" is referring to the subject of the sentence, which is the entity that had been working on the house. In this sentence, the carpenter is the one performing the action (telling the onlooker), and the onlooker is the one receiving the information. The carpenter is not the one working on the house; they're just describing someone else.

Therefore, the sentence suggests that the carpenter is telling the onlooker that someone else has been working on the house. This someone else could be the carpenter themselves, but that would be unusual. It's more likely that the carpenter is referring to themselves or another entity working on the house.

The correct answer is:
Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The pronoun ""they"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is ""the carpenter"" and also ""the onlooker"". However, ""the carpenter"" is the one performing the action of working on the house, whereas ""the onlooker"" is someone watching the scene.

Since ""the carpenter"" is the one working on the house, it's more likely that ""they"" refers to ""the carpenter"" rather than ""the onlooker"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence states ""The carpenter told the onlooker that they had been working on the house for three weeks.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to someone who had been working on the house for three weeks. The question is, who is that person?

The phrase ""The carpenter told the onlooker"" implies that the event of telling is related to the carpenter and the onlooker. However, it doesn't provide direct information about who had been working on the house.

So, we need to consider the possibilities:

(A) The carpenter had been working on the house: This option seems plausible, as the carpenter is likely the one who would be working on the house. But wait, the sentence says ""they had been working,"" implying that it's not the carpenter who is being referred to.

(B) The onlooker had been working on the house: This option doesn't quite fit, as the onlooker seems more likely to be someone observing the carpenter's work rather than the one doing it.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""This story could not be published without the writer and her friends' support.""

The pronoun in question is ""her friends"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify what ""her"" refers to.

(B) ""They were the friends' friends"" - This option is incorrect. The antecedent would be the friends' friends of whom friends, but the sentence doesn't make sense in this context.

(C) ""They were the story's friends"" - This option is incorrect. The sentence doesn't mention the story having friends.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's analyze the sentence step by step.

The sentence is: ""This story could not be published without the writer and her friends' support.""

The pronoun in this sentence is ""her friends"". We need to find out what it refers to.

The phrase ""her friends"" is possessive, denoting something that belongs to the writer. This suggests that the writer has friends, and those friends are being referred to.

The antecedent of the pronoun ""her friends"" is the writer's group of friends, not referring to any other group or entity.

(C) Ambiguous
End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's analyze the sentence step by step.

The sentence is: ""The assistant asked the physician if they could borrow some money.""

The pronoun is ""they"". To find the antecedent of ""they"", we need to identify which noun in the sentence ""they"" refers to.

The sentence starts with ""The assistant asked..."", which means ""assistant"" is the one doing the asking. The sentence then says ""the physician"" is the one being asked. The verb ""asked"" is in the third person singular, meaning it's not ""assistant"" or ""physician"" doing the asking, but rather a third person.

Since ""assistant"" and ""physician"" are both third-person nouns, ""they"" could potentially refer to either one of them. However, in this context, it's more likely that ""they"" refers to the physician, as ""physician"" is the one being asked. This is because ""physician"" is the recipient of the question, whereas ""assistant"" is the one asking the question.

Therefore, I would choose option (B) as the final answer.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The assistant asked the physician if they could borrow some money.""

The pronoun ""they"" appears in the sentence, and we need to find the antecedent to determine what it refers to.

The antecedent is the noun that the pronoun replaces, and in this sentence, it's the subject of the question being asked to the physician.

The sentence says ""if they could borrow some money"", which means the physician is being asked a question about borrowing money. Therefore, it's more likely that the ""they"" refers to the physician, who is being asked if they can borrow money.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence: ""The assistant asked the physician if they could borrow some money.""

* The pronoun is ""they"".
* To find the antecedent, we need to look for the closest noun that could be replaced with the pronoun.
* The closest nouns are ""assistant"" and ""physician"".

Since ""assistant"" is the one performing the action of asking, it's more likely that the pronoun ""they"" refers to the assistant, who is able to borrow the money.

""The cleaner called the guard and asked them to open the door.""

* ""The cleaner"" is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of calling and asking.
* ""The guard"" is the object of the calling action and is being asked to open the door.
* ""They"" is the pronoun that refers to the one performing the asking action.

So, the antecedent of ""them"" is ""the cleaner"", as it is the subject that is performing the asking action.

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The cleaner called the guard and asked them to open the door.""

The pronoun is ""them"". To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun phrase that ""them"" refers to.

The nouns in the sentence are ""cleaner"" and ""guard"".

The verb ""called"" is linked to ""the guard"", and the verb ""asked"" is linked to the subject of the sentence, which is ""the cleaner"".

So, we can see that ""them"" is actually referring to ""the guard"", as it was ""the guard"" who was asked to open the door.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The cleaner called the guard and asked them to open the door.""

We have a noun phrase ""the cleaner"" that is the subject of the sentence, and a noun phrase ""the guard"" that is the object of the verb ""called"". Then we have the verb ""asked"" which is in the same sentence as the verb ""called"".

The pronoun ""them"" is a subject pronoun, so it has to refer to the subject of the sentence ""asked"". Therefore, ""them"" has to refer back to either ""the cleaner"" or ""the guard"". Since the guard didn't perform the action of asking, it is unlikely that ""them"" refers to ""the guard"". 

Therefore, the most likely antecedent of ""them"" is ""the cleaner"", who is the one who asked.

The sentence is: ""The mechanic greets the receptionist because he is standing in front of the door.""

* ""The mechanic"" refers to a specific person, the subject of the sentence.
* ""he"" is a pronoun that refers to the person performing the action described in the sentence, which is ""greeting"". In this case, ""greet"" is the verb and it requires the subject acting upon the object.
* Since ""the mechanic"" is already mentioned as the one greasing the receptionist, ""he"" logically refers back to ""the mechanic"".

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the noun that appears earlier in the sentence. In this case, the nouns are ""mechanic"" and ""receptionist"".

The sentence states that the mechanic greets the receptionist because of something related to where the mechanic is standing. Therefore, it's likely that the pronoun ""he"" refers to the mechanic.

Final Answer ((A)).
Let's analyze the sentence together.

The sentence is: ""The mechanic greets the receptionist because he is standing in front of the door.""

The pronoun in question is ""he"".

To find the antecedent, we need to look back in the sentence for a noun or pronoun that refers to the same thing as ""he"". In this case, the possibilities are:

* ""mechanic"" (a male noun)
* ""receptionist"" (a female noun, but we're not assuming gender from the sentence)

The sentence mentions two individuals: the mechanic and the receptionist. But it's not clear who ""he"" is referring to. Is it the mechanic performing a masculine action (greating)? Is it the receptionist being referred to with a masculine pronoun (even though it's a female noun)?

Since the sentence doesn't provide enough context or grammatical clues to disambiguate, we can conclude that the antecedent of ""he"" is ambiguous.

The pronoun is ""his"".

The options are:

(A) It was the educator's grading policy
(B) It was the student's grading policy
(C) Ambiguous

To determine the antecedent, we need to look for the noun or phrase that the pronoun refers to.

In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" is likely referring to the noun ""educator"", as the educator is the one having a policy (grading policy) that needs to be discussed.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The educator was meeting with a student to discuss his grading policy.""

The pronoun is ""his"", which refers to the object of the preposition ""with"". The object of the preposition is ""a student"".

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is the student.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The educator was meeting with a student to discuss his grading policy.""

The pronoun ""his"" refers to the student who is being met with. The reason for this is that ""a student"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""his"" is the possessive pronoun referring to a male student.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is:

The sentence is: ""The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but he was too late.""

The pronoun is ""he"". To determine its antecedent, we need to find the noun or pronoun that it refers to.

The options are:

* ""The investigator"" (A)
* ""The witness"" (B)
* Ambiguous (C)

When we read the sentence, we can see that ""he"" appears in the second part of the sentence, while ""The investigator"" appears in the first part.

The antecedent of ""he"" is the noun that it logically refers to. In this case, it makes more sense for ""he"" to refer to ""The witness"", as it's more likely that the witness was too late for the interview, rather than the investigator. The investigator would likely be the one performing the interview, so it wouldn't make sense for them to be too late.

Therefore, the correct antecedent for the pronoun ""he"" is ""The witness"".

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence ""The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but he was too late.""

The pronoun ""he"" refers to:

* The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but **the investigator** was too late.

So, the correct antecedent is:

Final Answer ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but he was too late.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is a subject, and the sentence is a compound sentence with a contrast between two clauses. The two clauses are:

1. The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person.
2. He was too late.

The verb ""was"" agrees with the subject ""he"", which implies that ""he"" is a person or a thing that can be late. This makes more sense if ""he"" refers to the witness, who is the one who can be late for the interview.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the witness.

The sentence is ""Alex tells us that they could not meet.""

The pronoun is ""they"". To identify the antecedent, we need to find the noun or noun phrase that ""they"" refers to.

In this sentence, we have:

* ""Alex"" (a singular noun)
* ""us"" (an object pronoun, which refers back to the subject ""we"")

Now, let's look at the options:

(A) ""Alex could not meet"" - In this option, ""they"" wouldn't refer to Alex, because Alex is a singular noun, and ""they"" is a plural pronoun.

(B) ""We could not meet"" - This option seems more plausible, as ""they"" could potentially refer to ""us"", the object pronoun that appears before ""that"" clause.

(C) ""Ambiguous"" - This option isn't entirely accurate, as the pronoun ""they"" has a clear referent in the sentence. However, one could argue that the sentence is slightly awkwardly phrased, and a more precise or natural way to write it would be ""Alex tells us that we could not meet"". But in this sentence, the intended meaning is still ""we"" (the subject ""us"") rather than ""Alex"" or some other referent.

So, while it's true that the sentence could be rewritten for greater clarity, the most natural interpretation is that ""they"" refers to the subject ""us"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down:

* ""tells"" is a verb that indicates the subject of the sentence is the one doing the telling.
* ""us"" is the object of the verb ""tells"", referring to the person(s) being told.
* ""that"" is a subordinating conjunction introducing a subordinate clause.
* ""they"" is a pronoun that is being used to refer to someone or something.

Since ""tells"" indicates Alex is the subject doing the telling, and ""us"" is the object of the telling, we can conclude that ""they"" must refer to Alex, not ""us"".

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break down the sentence:

""Alex tells us that they could not meet.""

* ""Alex tells us"" indicates that the subject of the sentence is Alex, and the object is ""us"".
* ""that"" is a subordinating conjunction introducing a dependent clause.
* ""they could not meet"" is the dependent clause.

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to a subject, which can't be determined solely based on the sentence structure. It could refer to Alex, since Alex is the subject of the main clause, but it could also refer to ""us"", since ""they"" is a replacement for the subject of the dependent clause.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""they"" is ambiguous.

* The sentence continues with ""because they needed to understand the case.""
* The pronoun ""they"" is referring to someone who needs to understand the case.
* We can't simply substitute ""The lawyer needed to understand"" because the sentence doesn't support that idea (the lawyer is the one investigating the case, not the one needing to understand it).
* We can't substitute ""The cashier needed to understand"" either, because the sentence implies that the investigation is happening against the cashier, not that the cashier is the one who needs to understand the case.

Given these steps, it's clear that the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous. The sentence doesn't clearly specify who needs to understand the case, other than that it's someone who is doing the investigating.

(A) ""The lawyer needed to understand"": This option refers to the lawyer performing the action of understanding, but the pronoun ""they"" is not referring to the lawyer.

(B) ""The cashier needed to understand"": This option refers to the cashier, against whom the accusations are made, and the pronoun ""they"" is indeed referring to the cashier.

(C) ""Ambiguous"": The sentence could be interpreted as ambiguous because the pronoun ""they"" could refer to either the lawyer or the cashier. However, contextually, it is more likely that ""they"" refers to the lawyer, as the lawyer is the one actively looking into the accusations.

1. The sentence is talking about a reason why the nurse is running away. This reason is because ""he"" (the pronoun) smelled awful.
2. We need to find the antecedent of ""he"", which is the thing that the pronoun refers to.
3. The only two options that can refer to the pronoun ""he"" are ""the nurse"" and ""the laborer"".
4. If the nurse smelled awful, it wouldn't make sense for the nurse to be running away from their own smell.

The sentence mentions two individuals: ""the mechanic"" and ""the receptionist"". The sentence states that ""she"" is doing something: ""is standing in front of the door"".

The only action that is associated with ""she"" is standing in front of the door. Therefore, it's likely that ""she"" refers to the one who is performing this action.

Out of the two individuals mentioned, only one is doing the action mentioned: ""standing in front of the door"". That is the receptionist.

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to a specific person or entity that has performed some action in the sentence. The sentence says ""The mechanic greets the receptionist because [reason]"".

The reason given is ""she is standing in front of the door"". This implies that the person referred to by ""she"" is doing something related to the door.

Now, we look at the options:

(A) The mechanic is standing in front of the door: This is unlikely, as the sentence mentions the mechanic greeting the receptionist. It doesn't make sense for the mechanic to be standing in front of the door and receiving a greeting.

(B) The receptionist is standing in front of the door: This is a more plausible explanation. If the receptionist is standing in front of the door, it's reasonable that the mechanic would greet her. The sentence doesn't specifically say that the mechanic or the receptionist is moving, so it's possible that the receptionist is already in position.

(C) Ambiguous: This could be a valid answer, as the sentence doesn't explicitly state who is standing in front of the door. It's possible to interpret the sentence in a way where the mechanic is standing in front of the door instead.

* ""The receptionist"" is another possible candidate. The sentence states ""because she is standing in front of the door"", which suggests that the reason the mechanic greets the receptionist is because something about the receptionist's location.

* ""The worker"" is the subject, and ""the pedestrian"" is the indirect object.
* The clause ""that she should avoid the closed portion of the street"" is a subordinate clause, describing what the pedestrian should do.
* The pronoun ""she"" is likely referring to the indirect object, ""the pedestrian"".

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ""the pedestrian"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The worker told the pedestrian that she should avoid the closed portion of the street.""

We need to find the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"". An antecedent is the noun or phrase that a pronoun replaces in a sentence.

The pronoun ""she"" is the object of the verb ""should avoid"", which is in the sentence ""that she should avoid the closed portion of the street"".

The sentence ""that she should avoid the closed portion of the street"" is a subordinate clause, and ""she"" is the subject of this clause. Therefore, ""she"" refers to the pedestrian, not the worker.

1. The sentence mentions a developer and a designer.
2. The pronoun ""her"" is introduced, which refers to someone's idea.
3. The sentence does not explicitly state whose idea ""her"" refers to, but we can make an educated guess based on the context.

Since the developer met with the designer, it's more likely that the designer's idea is being referred to. This is because the developer is meeting with the designer, which suggests that they are discussing the designer's work.

Based on this reasoning, I believe the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The developer met with the designer because her idea can be implemented.""

The pronoun ""her"" is referring to the one who has an idea that can be implemented.

The sentence doesn't explicitly state who the developer and designer are, but it gives us some context. The developer is the one doing the meeting, and the designer is the one being met.

Since ""her"" is being used to refer to someone who has an idea, it's more logical to assume that the designer is the one who has an idea that can be implemented.

In this sentence, the verb ""told"" is in the passive voice, so the subject of the sentence is ""the onlooker"". This means that the pronoun ""he"" is not referring to the subject of the sentence (the onlooker), but rather it's likely referring to the doer of the action in the subordinate clause, which is ""the carpenter"".

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is likely:

(A) The carpenter

Final Answer ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The carpenter told the onlooker that he had been working on the house for three weeks.""

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the subject of the clause ""that he had been working on the house for three weeks"", which is a subordinate clause.

The only possible subject of the subordinate clause is the one doing the action of ""working on the house"", which is either the carpenter or the onlooker.

So, the question is which one is more likely to be working on the house?

The context doesn't provide a clear hint, so it's ambiguous. The sentence can be interpreted in two ways:

1. The carpenter had been working on the house for three weeks.
2. The onlooker had been working on the house for three weeks.

Since the sentence doesn't provide enough information to disambiguate, the answer is:

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break down the sentence and identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to someone who had been working on the house for three weeks.

The sentence mentions two entities: the carpenter and the onlooker. The carpenter is the one telling the onlooker something, so it's unlikely that the carpenter is the one who had been working on the house.

That leaves the onlooker as the only remaining option. It doesn't make sense for the onlooker to have been working on the house, as the sentence states that the carpenter told the onlooker that he (the carpenter?) had been working on the house.

Conclusion: The pronoun ""he"" refers to the carpenter.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The sheriff protected the writer because they uphold the peace.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

The question is, what does ""they"" refer to?

We can start by looking at the easier part of the sentence: ""the writer"". This is a specific person, the one who is being protected.

Now, let's move on to the phrase ""uphold the peace"". This phrase suggests an action that is being performed, not by the sheriff, but by someone else. The sheriff is protecting the writer because of this action.

Given this information, it seems more likely that ""they"" refers to the writer, since the writer is the one who is performing the action ""uphold the peace"".

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the writer.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The sheriff protected the writer because they uphold the peace.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to the subject of the dependent clause ""because they uphold the peace"".

The subject of the dependent clause is the one performing the action described by the verb ""uphold the peace"". Since the sheriff protected the writer, it doesn't make sense for the writer to be upholding the peace, as the writer is the one being protected.

On the other hand, the sheriff's role is to maintain order and peace, so it makes sense for the sheriff to be the one upholding the peace.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""The sheriff protected the writer"" sets up a relationship between the sheriff and the writer.
* ""because"" indicates a reason for the sheriff's action.
* ""they"" is the pronoun that we need to identify the antecedent for.

The closest noun in the sentence to the pronoun ""they"" is ""writer"", which is the object of the original sentence. Therefore, the antecedent of ""they"" is the writer.

The sentence is: ""The reporter and the chef discussed his favorite dishes.""

The pronoun is ""his"".

The subject of the sentence is ""the reporter and the chef"". This is a compound subject, consisting of two individuals: the reporter and the chef.

The question is, whether ""his"" refers to the reporter's or the chef's favorite dishes.

In the sentence, ""his"" doesn't have a clear antecedent. Both the reporter and the chef are male, so it's not immediately clear which one is being referred to.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The reporter and the chef discussed his favorite dishes.""

The pronoun is ""his"", and we need to determine what it refers to.

The sentence has two nouns: ""reporter"" and ""chef"". The phrase ""his favorite dishes"" is not modified to indicate which one it belongs to. Therefore, we can't clearly say that ""his"" refers to one specific person.

Final Answer = (C)
Let's break down the sentence together.

The sentence is: ""The reporter and the chef discussed his favorite dishes.""

The pronoun is ""his"".

To find the antecedent of ""his"", we need to look for the noun that it replaces. The options are ""reporter"" and ""chef"".

Since the sentence starts with ""The reporter and the chef"", it's likely that the pronoun ""his"" refers to one of the two nouns.

The key is to realize that the sentence is assuming a shared context between the reporter and the chef. The usage of ""his"" implies a joint action (""discussed""), which suggests that the pronoun refers to a shared entity or a common subject.

In this case, the most likely antecedent of ""his"" is the two individuals together, rather than one individual. This makes the sentence ambiguous, as it's not explicitly clear who ""his"" refers to.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down!

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is Alex. However, Alex is a person, and it's possible that Alex is referring to someone else as ""he"". In this case, it would not be explicitly clear who ""he"" is.

The sentence is: ""The hygienist told the patient that she should floss every day.""

The pronoun is ""she"".

To find the antecedent, we need to identify what ""she"" refers to.

The sentence states that ""the hygienist told the patient something"", and ""something"" is the clause ""that she should floss every day"".

So, ""she"" is likely referring to the person who should floss (either the hygienist or the patient).

A hygienist is unlikely to be advised to floss daily, so it's more likely that ""she"" refers to the patient.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The hygienist told the patient that she should floss every day.""

The pronoun is ""she"". To determine the antecedent, we need to find the closest noun that agrees with the pronoun in gender (in this case, feminine).

The closest nouns to the pronoun ""she"" are ""hygienist"" (feminine) and ""patient"" (non-feminine). Since the hygienist is the one performing the action (telling), it's unlikely that they are referring to themselves. Therefore, the most likely antecedent is the ""patient"".

The sentence is: ""The hygienist told the patient that she should floss every day.""

The pronoun is ""she"". To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun that the pronoun refers to.

""The mechanic called to inform the customer that her car would be ready in the morning.""

The pronoun ""her"" refers to the closest noun that is functioning as a person or an animal. In this case, the closest noun is ""customer"", which is a person. Therefore, ""her"" refers to the customer.

The pronoun ""them"" refers to the person(s) that the carpenter makes the desk for. In this case, it is the clerk.

So, the correct answer is the one that associates the discount with the clerk. 

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave them a discount.""

The pronoun ""them"" is referring to someone. The question is, who is ""them"" referring to?

The subject of the sentence is the carpenter, who is performing the action of making a desk and giving a discount. The phrase ""for the clerk"" indicates that the desk is intended for the clerk, so it's likely that the clerk is the recipient of the desk.

The verb ""gave"" is followed by the pronoun ""them"", which indicates that ""them"" is the indirect object of the verb ""gave"". Since the desk is already addressed to the clerk, it's more likely that ""them"" refers to the clerk, rather than the carpenter.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"" is the clerk.

Final Answer: ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave them a discount.""

The pronoun ""them"" refers to the group of entities being addressed. In this sentence, ""them"" is a plural object pronoun that refers to either the carpenter and the clerk, or only the clerk. There are two options:

(A) Gave the carpenter a discount: This option is incorrect because the carpenter is the one making the desk, not receiving it.

(B) Gave the clerk a discount: This option is possible because the clerk is the intended recipient of the desk and therefore could be the intended recipient of the discount as well.

(C) Ambiguous: This option is also possible because one could argue that the pronoun ""them"" could refer to the carpenter and the clerk together, receiving a joint discount.

After considering the options, I conclude that the answer is:

1. Identify the pronoun: ""they""
2. Determine the correct antecedent, which is the noun that the pronoun refers to.

In this case, both ""mechanic"" and ""cashier"" are candidate antecedents, as both are nouns that the pronoun ""they"" could refer to.

However, based on the sentence structure and the typical pattern of pronoun reference, it is more likely that ""they"" refers to the ""cashier"". This is because the sentence is discussing a reason why the mechanic dislikes the cashier, and it is more plausible that the mechanic's dislike stems from the cashier's behavior (being arrogant) rather than the mechanic's own behavior.

Final Answer = (B)
Let's break down the sentence:

""The mechanic disliked the cashier because they are arrogant.""

The pronoun ""they"" is replacing a noun in the sentence. To find the antecedent, we need to look back and see what noun it could be referring to.

The options are:

* The mechanic (this would imply that the mechanic is arrogant)
* The cashier (this would imply that the cashier is arrogant)

Based on the sentence structure and meaning, the most likely antecedent for the pronoun ""they"" is the cashier, as the sentence is saying that the mechanic dislikes the cashier because of something about the cashier (""they are arrogant"").

Final Answer = ((B))
To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"", we need to identify who is being described as arrogant. 

The sentence states ""because they are arrogant"". This phrase is describing someone's behavior, and based on the sentence structure, it's more likely that the cashier is being described as arrogant, as they are the one being compared to the mechanic in the first part of the sentence (""The mechanic disliked the cashier because..."").

2. The pronoun is ""she"".
3. To identify the antecedent of ""she"", we need to find the noun that it refers to.
4. The nouns in the sentence are: ""developer"", ""secretary"".
5. Since ""she"" is the subject of the clause ""she better understood the problem"", it must refer to a female noun.
6. In the sentence, the ""secretary"" is a female noun, so ""she"" likely refers to the ""secretary"".

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the ""secretary"".

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down.

The sentence is ""The developer corrected the secretary because she better understood the problem.""

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to someone who understood the problem better. We need to figure out who that person is.

The word ""because"" introduces a reason for an action, which is the developer correcting the secretary. So, the sentence is setting up a cause-and-effect relationship.

The phrase ""because she better understood the problem"" is providing the reason for the developer's action.

Now, let's look at the people mentioned in the sentence: the developer and the secretary. The developer is the one performing the action of correcting the secretary, but the sentence doesn't mention the developer understanding the problem. Instead, it mentions someone (who is referred to as ""she"") who better understood the problem.

Given this information, it seems most likely that ""she"" is referring to the secretary, as the sentence is describing why the developer corrected the secretary. The secretary is the one who better understood the problem, leading the developer to correct her.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""The developer corrected the secretary"" suggests that the developer is the one performing the action of correcting.
* The next phrase ""because"" indicates a reason for the action.
* The clause ""she better understood the problem"" is the reason. This clause is describing the entity that performed the action.

The pronoun ""she"" must refer to the entity that better understood the problem, which is likely the one being corrected, which is the secretary. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is the secretary.

The sentence is: ""The patient was referred to the specialist because she is an expert on rare skin conditions.""

The pronoun in this sentence is ""she"".

To find the antecedent of the pronoun, we need to look back in the sentence and see what noun is referred to by the pronoun.

The closest noun to the pronoun ""she"" is ""the specialist"". However, the sentence is unlikely to mean that the specialist is being referred to as an expert because this would be an unusual or illogical reason for referring a patient to a specialist.

Therefore, we need to look further back in the sentence to find the correct antecedent.

Final Answer ((A)).
To determine the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"", let's look at the sentence again:

""The patient was referred to the specialist because she is an expert on rare skin conditions.""

The phrase ""an expert on rare skin conditions"" is a description of something or someone. The pronoun ""she"" must refer back to the thing or person that is described by this phrase.

The only options in the sentence are ""the patient"" and ""the specialist"". Of these two, only ""the patient"" can be an ""expert on rare skin conditions"". It doesn't make sense for ""the specialist"" to be referred to as an expert on the condition, as the specialist is the one being referred to, not an expert on the condition (the condition is the thing being referred to, not the specialist).

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ""the patient"".

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down step by step.

* The sentence is: ""The patient was referred to the specialist because she is an expert on rare skin conditions.""
* The pronoun is ""she"".
* The question is: What is the antecedent of ""she""?

The closest noun to ""she"" is ""specialist"", but the sentence doesn't indicate that the specialist is the expert. In fact, the sentence says ""an expert on rare skin conditions"", which implies that it's someone who knows a lot about rare skin conditions, but it doesn't say who that person is.

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The reporter and the chef will discuss their favorite dishes.""

The pronoun is ""their"".

((A)).","Let's analyze the sentence: ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because they used big words.""

The pronoun is ""they"". To identify its antecedent, we need to find the noun that the pronoun refers to.

The sentence is: ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because they used big words.""

We have two nouns: ""developer"" and ""writer"". The verb ""used"" is describing the action of the pronoun ""they"", so ""they"" must refer to the one who performed the action specified by the sentence.

The sentence is unclear about which one used big words. It could be the developer, and the sentence would mean the developer used big words that made communication with the writer difficult. Or it could be the writer, and the sentence would mean the writer used big words that made communication with the developer difficult.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous.
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because they used big words.""

The pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to the entity that ""used big words"". The only entities in the sentence are ""the developer"" and ""the writer"". Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is likely to be one of these two entities.

Option (A) refers to the developer, but it doesn't make sense because the developer is unable to communicate with the writer, not because they themselves used big words.

Option (B) refers to the writer, which makes more sense because it explains why the developer is unable to communicate with the writer - the writer is using big words that the developer can't understand.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence says ""they used big words"", which is the part we need to figure out the antecedent for.

The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun ""they"" refers to.

The sentence mentions a developer and a writer, but it doesn't explicitly state which one used big words.

However, the context suggests that the writer might be more likely to use big words, as the developer is unable to communicate with them. This implies that the writer is the one who is using big words, making it more likely that ""they"" refers to the writer.

The sentence is: ""The pathologist obtained tissue samples from the victim to look at under her microscope.""

The pronoun is ""her"".

* ""her"" is a possessive adjective modifying the noun ""microscope"".
* The question is: whom does ""her"" belong to?

The options are: A) the pathologist's, B) the victim's, or C) ambiguous.

Since the sentence is describing the action of the pathologist, it is likely that ""her"" refers to the pathologist. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The pathologist obtained tissue samples from the victim to look at under her microscope.""

The pronoun in this sentence is ""her"". To find the antecedent of the pronoun, we need to identify what ""her"" refers to.

The most likely interpretation is that ""her"" refers to the victim, since it is the victim from whom tissue samples were obtained. This makes sense because it is common for pathologists to examine tissue samples taken from the victim using a microscope.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down!

The pronoun is ""her"". To determine the antecedent, we need to find the noun or nouns that are closest to the pronoun and make sense in the context.

In this sentence, the options are ""the pathologist"" and ""the victim"". We can't say it's ""the victim's microscope"" because there's no mention of the victim having a microscope.

The next closest option is ""the pathologist"". The sentence mentions ""her microscope"", which implies that the pathologist is the one who owns or uses the microscope. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

""Before he sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor.""

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the person who sent the letter. The sentence doesn't explicitly state who that person is, but it must be either Alex or someone else. We can infer this from the fact that the sentence mentions Alex's action ""did not know Taylor"" before something happened, which is the letter being sent.

The key phrase is ""Before he sent the letter"". This implies that the letter was sent by the subject of the sentence ""he"". Since the sentence starts with ""Before he sent the letter"", it means that the person who sent the letter is the same person who did not know Taylor before sending the letter.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is:

(A) Alex sent the letter

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""Before he sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor.""

The pronoun is ""he"", and we need to find its antecedent.

The antecedent is the noun or phrase that the pronoun refers to. In this case, the word ""before"" indicates that the event described by ""he sent the letter"" has not yet occurred. Therefore, the sentence is setting up a situation where ""he"" has not yet sent the letter, but will do so in the future.

Since ""Alex"" is the subject of the main clause, it cannot be the antecedent of ""he"", as it would imply that Alex sent the letter, which is not what the sentence is saying.

The next option is ""Taylor"", but it doesn't make sense either. The sentence is stating that Alex didn't know Taylor before a certain event, and that event is the sending of the letter. But ""he"" can't be referring to Taylor, as Taylor is not the one sending the letter.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""he"" is necessarily something else. Since the sentence doesn't specify who sent the letter, we cannot determine with certainty who ""he"" refers to.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence says ""Before he sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor.""

Here, ""he"" is the pronoun, and we need to find its antecedent, which is the thing it refers to.

The sentence doesn't mention a specific person who ""sent the letter"" yet. The only mention of the letter is that it's going to be sent, but we don't know who will be doing the sending.

Since Alex is the subject of the sentence, it's most plausible to conclude that Alex is the one who will be sending the letter. However, the sentence doesn't explicitly state that.

* ""The patient"" is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of disclosing.
* ""had a history"" is a subordinate clause functioning as a noun phrase, modifying ""of substance abuse"".
* ""he"" is the pronoun being referred to.

Now, let's think about what ""he"" could refer to:

* Logically, ""he"" is most likely referring back to ""the patient"", as it is the patient who is performing the action of disclosing.
* ""The counselor"" is not a likely candidate, as it is not involved in having a history of substance abuse.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is likely to be ""the patient"".

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

* The patient is the one doing the disclosing.
* The subject of the sentence is ""The patient"".
* The sentence also mentions ""he"", which is a pronoun.
* To find the antecedent of ""he"", we need to identify who is performing the action of disclosing.

Only one entity is performing the action of disclosing, which is ""the patient"". Therefore, the antecedent of ""he"" is ""the patient"".

Final Answer ((A)).
Let's break it down:

* The sentence is: ""The patient disclosed to the counselor that he had a history of substance abuse.""
* The pronoun is: ""he""
* The options are: (A) The patient had a history, (B) The counselor had a history, or (C) Ambiguous

Since the pronoun ""she"" is already introduced, it is likely referring to the one closest to it. In this case, it refers to the ""artist"". If it referred to the ""scientist"", we would expect the sentence to start ""She collaborates with the artist...""

Therefore, the answer is:
Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The scientist collaborates with the artist, and she shares a story.""

The pronoun ""she"" appears at the end of the sentence, and we need to determine what it refers to. Let's look at the sentence structure:

* ""The scientist collaborates with the artist"" is a independent clause.
* ""and she shares a story"" is also an independent clause.

The pronoun ""she"" is introduced in the second independent clause, and it doesn't have a clear antecedent in the first clause. Both ""the scientist"" and ""the artist"" can be potential referents for ""she"", but there's no explicit indication which one it refers to.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = (C)
Let's break it down!

* The sentence has two clauses: ""The scientist collaborates with the artist"" and ""she shares a story"".
* The pronoun ""she"" appears in the second clause, but it's not clear which antecedent it refers to - the scientist or the artist.
* Since the pronoun ""she"" does not have an explicit antecedent within the same clause (i.e., there is no ""the scientist shares"" or ""the artist shares"" in the same clause), we must look to the entire sentence for the context.
* The joint action of ""collaborates with"" implies a partnership, but it doesn't necessarily imply that one is the agent of the sharing story.
* Therefore, the antecedent of ""she"" is ambiguous between the scientist and the artist.

The only nouns mentioned in the sentence are ""the developer"" and ""the secretary"". If the developer made a mistake, the sentence would imply that the developer met with the secretary because the developer made a mistake, which seems unlikely. It's more likely that the error is associated with the person the developer met with, which is the secretary.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is likely to be ""the secretary"".

Final Answer = ((B))
To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"", we need to identify the noun that is referenced by the pronoun.

In the sentence, ""The developer met with the secretary because..."" implies that someone made a mistake, and the meeting is a consequence of that mistake. This implies that the mistake was made by the secretary, not the developer.

The pronoun ""she"" refers to the noun ""secretary"", which is the one that made the mistake.

(A) The developer made a mistake
(B) The secretary made a mistake
(C) Ambiguous

The correct answer is (B) The secretary made a mistake.

The reason is that the sentence indicates that the meeting took place because of something the secretary did, which is making a mistake. It's unlikely that the developer made the mistake and then met with the secretary to discuss the mistake the secretary made.

The sentence is: ""After meeting with the producers, Sam went to their office.""

The pronoun is ""their"", which is referring to either the producers or Sam. We need to find out who owns the office.

The possessive pronoun ""their"" can belong to either the producers or Sam, since both have been mentioned in the sentence. The producers are mentioned as the ones with whom Sam met, but it's possible that Sam has a shared office with the producers or even has a personal office.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""After meeting with the producers, Sam went to their office.""

The pronoun in question is ""their"". It refers to a noun that has been previously mentioned in the sentence.

The clause ""after meeting with the producers"" provides the context. It means that ""their"" must refer to someone who met with the producers.

The subject of the sentence is ""Sam"", and the sentence describes what Sam did after meeting with the producers.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) ""The office was the producers' office"". This is a possible interpretation, as ""their"" could refer back to the producers. If this is the case, ""their office"" would mean the office belonging to the producers.

(B) ""The office was Sam's office"". This is also a possible interpretation, as ""their"" could refer back to Sam. If this is the case, ""their office"" would mean the office belonging to Sam.

(C) ""Ambiguous"". While both options are possible, the sentence is actually ambiguous because it doesn't provide enough context to disambiguate the reference. Without more information, it's unclear whether ""their"" refers to the producers or Sam.

So, the final answer is:

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's break it down step by step.

* ""After meeting with the producers, Sam..."" - The pronoun ""their"" is referring to the antecedent that comes before it. In this sentence, the antecedent is ""the producers"".

""The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told him a fake story.""

The pronoun ""him"" refers to the antecedent before the verb ""told"". The antecedent is the person who is being deceived (fooled). Since the writer is the one trying to fool the salesperson, the salesperson is the one who is being deceived.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told him a fake story.""

The pronoun ""him"" refers to the same thing as the word it replaces, which is typically signified by the phrase ""the antecedent"".

The word ""him"" is the object of the verb ""told"", which is part of the action of the sentence.

The sentence also mentions ""the writer"" and ""the salesperson"" as entities that are being connected to the action.

The sentence suggests that ""the writer"" is the one doing the telling, and ""the salesperson"" is the one being told to. This implies that the subject-verb agreement in the sentence creates a relationship between ""the writer"" and the action of ""told"", whereas ""the salesperson"" is the object of the action.

So, the pronoun ""him"" refers to the salesperson.

Final Answer = (B).
Let's analyze the sentence step by step.

The sentence is: ""The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told him a fake story.""

1. We have two nouns: ""writer"" and ""salesperson"".
2. The sentence starts with ""The writer"", which implies that the writer is the subject performing the action.
3. The phrase ""tried to fool the salesperson"" indicates that the writer is trying to deceive the salesperson.
4. The sentence then continues with ""and told him a fake story"", which is a continuation of the writer's action.

Now, let's focus on the pronoun ""him"". What does ""him"" refer to?

The most reasonable interpretation is that ""him"" refers to the salesperson, since the writer is trying to deceive the salesperson and the story is being told to the salesperson.

Therefore, the correct answer is the option that implies the salesperson received the fake story.

The sentence is: ""The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave them a prototype.""

The pronoun in question is ""them"".

The phrase ""the carpenter"" refers to a singular entity, whereas ""them"" is a plural pronoun.

In English, when we have a plural antecedent, it usually refers to multiple entities. In this case, we have two antecedents: ""the carpenter"" and ""the designer"".

Therefore, we cannot determine which one is the intended recipient of the prototype. It is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave them a prototype.""

The pronoun in question is ""them"". To determine the antecedent of ""them"", we need to look for the closest noun that refers back to it.

The closest nouns are ""carpenter"" and ""designer"". The sentence states that the carpenter collaborated with the designer, so we can infer that the carpenter and designer are the two individuals that the carpenter gave something to.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"" is the phrase ""the carpenter and the designer"", which is referring to the two individuals as a single unit.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence step by step.

The sentence is: ""The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave them a prototype.""

The key to identifying the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"" is to identify the noun phrase that is most closely related to the verb ""gave"". In this case, the verb ""gave"" is in the same sentence as both ""the carpenter"" and ""the designer"". Therefore, we need to look at the meaning of the sentence to determine which of the two is more likely to be the recipient of the prototype.

The sentence implies that the carpenter is working together with the designer to create something, and then gives a prototype to both of them. This suggests that the ""them"" refers to both the carpenter and the designer, as they are the two people collaborating and receiving the prototype.

Therefore, I would argue that the correct answer is:

The pronoun is ""him"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify what the pronoun refers to.

The subject of the sentence is ""the carpenter"", which makes the desk for the clerk. The sentence is describing an action done by the carpenter to the clerk.

The phrase ""gave him a discount"" is describing an action done to the same person (the clerk) that the desk was made for. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is ""the clerk"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence step by step:

* The carpenter made a desk for the clerk: This indicates a relationship between the carpenter, the desk, and the clerk (the desk is being made for the clerk).
* and gave him a discount: This part of the sentence introduces a new action (giving a discount) and refers to someone using the pronoun ""him"".

The pronoun ""him"" must refer to the person who is the recipient of the action being described in the sentence (giving a discount). Since the sentence has already established a relationship between the carpenter, the desk, and the clerk, it is most likely that ""him"" refers to the clerk.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave him a discount.""

The pronoun ""him"" is referring to someone mentioned earlier in the sentence. The two potential referents are ""the carpenter"" and ""the clerk"".

In this case, it's more likely that ""him"" is referring to ""the clerk"" because the sentence mentions ""a desk for the clerk"", implying that the desk is for the clerk's benefit. It's less likely that the carpenter is receiving a discount, as the context doesn't suggest that the carpenter would be receiving something in return for making the desk.

The sentence is: ""The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because she needed to understand the case.""

The pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the subordinate clause, which is introduced by the subordinating conjunction ""because"". This subordinate clause provides the reason for the lawyer's action.

The phrase ""she needed to understand"" is the predicate of the subordinate clause, and ""she"" refers to the one who needs to understand. But who is that?

We can see that ""the lawyer"" is the main subject of the sentence, but the phrase ""because she needed to understand"" is describing the motivation for the lawyer's action. Therefore, the most logical antecedent for the pronoun ""she"" is ""the lawyer"" herself.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because she needed to understand the case.""

The pronoun is ""she"", and it refers to the person who needs to understand the case.

The options are:

(A) ""The lawyer needed to understand""
(B) ""The cashier needed to understand""
(C) ""Ambiguous""

Let's analyze each option:

(A) ""The lawyer needed to understand"" - This option implies that the lawyer herself needed to understand the case, which doesn't match the sentence. The sentence says ""she"", not ""the lawyer"".

(B) ""The cashier needed to understand"" - This option seems more likely. It implies that the cashier needed to understand the case, but why would the lawyer be investigating accusations against the cashier if the cashier needed to understand the case?

(C) ""Ambiguous"" - I think we can eliminate this option. While the sentence might be somewhat unclear, it's not entirely ambiguous. We can use context and analysis to identify the intended meaning.

So, after re-evaluating the options, I believe the answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because she needed to understand the case.

The pronoun is ""she"".

The phrase ""because she"" is introducing a dependent clause, which is giving a reason for the lawyer's action.

In this clause, ""she"" is referring to one of the nouns mentioned earlier in the sentence.

The nouns are ""the lawyer"" and ""the cashier"".

Since the phrase ""against the cashier"" indicates the target of the accusations, and the need to understand the case is related to investigating those accusations, it is logical to assume that ""she"" is referring to the cashier.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the cashier.

* ""the CEO"" is a plausible candidate for antecedent, but it's unlikely because the CEO is the one being helped, not doing the asking.
* ""the librarian"" is also unlikely because it's the one doing the helping, not asking.

To determine the antecedent of ""they"", we need to look for the noun or pronoun that it refers to.

The options are:

* (A) The librarian asked
* (B) The CEO asked
* (C) Ambiguous

The sentence structure is ""because they asked"", which implies that ""they"" is the subject that performed the action of asking. The verb ""asked"" is in the singular form, which suggests that it's referring to one person.

Since the librarian is performing the action of helping, it's unlikely that the librarian is the one asking. The CEO is also more likely to be the one asking, as they are the one looking for a book.

Therefore, the most logical antecedent for ""they"" is the CEO.

Final Answer = ((B)).

""The librarian helped the CEO to find the book because they asked.""

The pronoun is ""they"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify the subject-verb pair that matches the pronoun.

So, we have:

* ""The librarian"" (subject) helped ""the CEO"" (object)
* ""they asked"" (somebody asked something)

The question is: Who is ""they""? Who did the asking?

Since ""the librarian"" already helped ""the CEO"", it's unlikely that the librarian is the one who asked. The CEO might have asked for help, but the sentence structure suggests that the book was found because of someone else's request.

* Therefore, the antecedent of ""they"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either the scientist or the artist.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's break it down:

* ""The scientist collaborates with the artist"": This establishes two objects (""the scientist"" and ""the artist"") that are collaborating.
* ""and they share a story"": The pronoun ""they"" refers to the two objects that are collaborating, i.e. the scientist and the artist.

Since both the scientist and the artist are collaborating, it cannot be definitively said which one is sharing the story. It's ambiguous because both options (A and B) are possible.

Final Answer ((C)).

* ""The scientist collaborates with the artist"" sets up two entities: the scientist and the artist.
* ""and they"" refers back to the two entities that are collaborating.

""The assistant asked the physician if she needs any help.""

The pronoun in this sentence is ""she"", and we need to identify its antecedent.

The closest noun before the pronoun is ""physician"", which is a female and seems to be a good candidate to be the antecedent. However, the sentence also mentions an ""assistant"", which is also a noun close to the pronoun.

After careful consideration, I believe the intention of the sentence is to ask the physician if she needs help, rather than the assistant. The assistant is the one asking the question, and the physician is the one being asked about her needs.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The assistant asked the physician if she needs any help.""

The pronoun is ""she"".

To find the antecedent of the pronoun, I will look for the noun that the pronoun refers to. In this sentence, ""she"" is referring to a noun that is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. However, we can infer that ""she"" is referring to the one who is being asked if they need help. In this case, the likely candidates are the assistant or the physician.

The sentence ""The assistant asked the physician if she needs any help"" doesn't clearly indicate who is being asked, but we can make an educated guess based on the context.

In this case, we could interpret the sentence as either:
- The assistant is asking the physician if she needs help.
- The physician is asking the assistant if she needs help.

Since the sentence is unclear about who is asking and who is being asked, we can conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer ((C))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The assistant asked the physician if she needs any help.""

The pronoun ""she"" refers to the person being asked whether they need help. The sentence is asking the physician (""the physician"" is the object of the verb ""asked"") if they need help.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the ""physician"".

In the sentence, ""The surgeon warned the patient that they needed to get more rest.""

The pronoun ""they"" is used as the subject of the sentence ""needed to get more rest"". 

The word ""the patient"" comes before the pronoun, so it's likely that ""they"" refers to the patient.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is the patient.

Final Answer = (B).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The surgeon warned the patient that they needed to get more rest.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

What is the antecedent of ""they""?

Well, the closest noun that can be referred to by ""they"" is ""patient"", since the sentence is saying that something about the patient is needed.

So, the antecedent of ""they"" is indeed ""patient"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The sentence is: ""The surgeon warned the patient that they needed to get more rest.""

The pronoun is ""they"". Now, to determine the antecedent of ""they"", we need to look for the closest noun that refers to the same thing.

In the sentence, ""The surgeon warned the nurse that they needed more time to prepare.""

* ""they"" is the pronoun.
* The word ""they"" can refer to either ""the surgeon"" or ""the nurse"", since both are the ones being referred to in the context of the sentence.

So, it is not clear who specifically needs more time, making it AMBIGUOUS.

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The surgeon warned the nurse that they needed more time to prepare.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to someone or something that needs more time to prepare.

The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is a subject of the clause ""needed more time to prepare"". This means that the person or thing referred to by ""they"" is the one doing the preparing, not the surgeon or the nurse.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""they"" is likely to be a group or entity that is preparing something, which is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. It could be the surgical team, including the surgeon and the nurse, that needs more time to prepare.

According to the sentence structure and logic, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific individual, either the surgeon or the nurse, as the referent of ""they"".

So, I'd say the answer is:

Final Answer = (C).
Let's break down the sentence and identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"".

The sentence is: ""The surgeon warned the nurse that they needed more time to prepare.""

The word ""they"" appears in the phrase ""they needed more time to prepare."" To find the antecedent of ""they"", we need to identify what or who is performing the action of needing more time to prepare.

The sentence uses a subordinate clause ""that they needed more time to prepare"" which modifies the verb ""warned"". This means that the action of needing more time to prepare is something that the surgeon and the nurse are both aware of, and that the surgeon is warning the nurse about.

The most logical antecedent for ""they"" is the subject of the main clause, which is ""the surgeon and the nurse"". Therefore, ""the surgeon and the nurse"" is the antecedent of ""they"".

Let's break it down step by step:

* The sentence is ""The worker told the pedestrian that he should avoid the closed portion of the street.""
* The pronoun in question is ""he"".
* To find the antecedent, we need to ask what the pronoun ""he"" is referring to in the sentence.
* The closest noun in the sentence to the pronoun ""he"" is ""pedestrian"". This is because the sentence mentions ""the pedestrian"" right before it says ""that he should avoid..."".
* Therefore, the most likely answer is that the pronoun ""he"" refers to ""the pedestrian"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step!

In the sentence, ""he"" is the pronoun we're concerned about.

The sentence is ""The worker told the pedestrian that he should avoid the closed portion of the street.""

We need to find out what ""he"" refers to:

* ""The worker"" is a person doing the telling, but ""he"" is not the one doing the telling. Instead, ""he"" seems to be the subject receiving advice or instruction.
* ""The pedestrian"" is the one receiving the advice, but ""he"" does not match the pedestrian's gender (it's a masculine pronoun, whereas it's unclear what the pedestrian's gender is).

Given these observations, it seems most likely that ""he"" refers to the object being talked about - in this case, whoever should avoid the closed portion of the street. Therefore, the antecedent of ""he"" is:

(B) The pedestrian should avoid the closed portion

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down:

* The sentence is ""The worker told the pedestrian that he should avoid the closed portion of the street.""
* ""He"" is the pronoun that needs an antecedent.
* The closest antecedent is ""the pedestrian"", but we need to look back to see who is being addressed by the clause ""that he should avoid...""
* The verb ""told"" has a subject-verb agreement, which means the subject of ""told"" (the worker) is telling someone something. That someone is described as ""who should avoid the closed portion"".
* Based on this reasoning, it's clear that the pronoun ""he"" refers to the subject of the subordinate clause, which is the person who should avoid the closed portion.
* Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is ""the pedestrian"" (option B).

Let's break it down.

The sentence is: ""The mechanic greets the receptionist because he was in a good mood.""

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to someone who is in a good mood. The question is, which one: the mechanic or the receptionist?

Well, the sentence tells us that the mechanic greets the receptionist, which suggests that the mechanic is the one doing the greating. And ""he"" is used as a causal agent of the action of greeting. Therefore, ""he"" is most likely referring to the mechanic, not the receptionist.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The mechanic greets the receptionist because he was in a good mood.""

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to the subject of the subordinate clause ""because he was in a good mood"". This clause is describing the reason why the mechanic greets the receptionist.

The subject of the subordinate clause is the one who was in a good mood, which is not specified as either the mechanic or the receptionist.

The pronoun ""their"" refers to the antecedent, which is the entity that ""their"" is replacing.

The options are:

(A) It is Sam's office
(B) It is the producers' office
(C) Ambiguous

Looking at the sentence, the phrase ""meeting with the producers"" implies a direct association with the producers. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is likely to be the producers.

Conclusion: The antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is the producers.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to their office.""

The pronoun is ""their"". To find the antecedent, we need to see what ""their"" refers to.

The phrase ""after meeting with the producers"" implies that Sam has just met with the producers, and now Sam is going somewhere. The sentence is describing the action Sam takes after meeting with the producers.

Since both ""Sam"" and ""the producers"" are nouns in the sentence, we can consider both as possible antecedents for the pronoun ""their"". But which one is more likely to be the intended antecedent?

The word ""their"" typically implies a relationship of possession or association with the preceding noun. In this case, ""their"" is likely used to imply that the office belongs to or is associated with the producers. This makes more sense, as it suggests that Sam is going to the office of the people he just met with.

The sentence has two nouns: ""manager"" and ""secretary"".

The sentence says ""the manager sent a message to the secretary"", which implies that the manager is the one who sent the message. Therefore, ""she"" cannot refer to the manager because the manager is a male (it's defined as ""the"" manager, which is a definite article that is typically used with a masculine antecedent).

The sentence implies that the intended recipient of the message is the secretary. Since ""she"" is the subject that didn't reply yet, it's likely that ""she"" refers to the secretary.

In English, when we use a pronoun like ""her"", we typically expect it to refer to a noun that is closer to the pronoun than to another noun. In this case, the nouns are ""reporter"" and ""chef"".

Since ""reporter"" and ""chef"" are both singular nouns, and we're using a singular possessive pronoun (""her""), we have to choose between the two.

Since both nouns are mentioned together as a pair with ""and"", it's not entirely clear which one ""her"" would refer to. We can't rule out either possibility.

The pronoun ""her"" is referring to something. The options are:

Since ""her"" is a feminine pronoun, it's likely that it's referring to one of the two individuals mentioned, rather than the plural pronoun ""they"".

* The pronoun is referring to the subject of the sentence, which is: ""Alex"" or ""Taylor""
* Since ""Alex"" is already a person, it's unlikely that ""he"" refers to Alex.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is likely Taylor.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""Alex did not know Taylor until he sent a letter.""

The pronoun is ""he"", and the question is: what does ""he"" refer to?

From the context, we know that ""Alex"" is a person, and ""Taylor"" is another person. The sentence is saying that Alex didn't know Taylor until something happened (i.e., ""until he sent a letter""). The sentence implies a causal relationship between not knowing Taylor and the sending of a letter, and that the letter sender is the same person who didn't know Taylor.

Given this context, the most logical antecedent for the pronoun ""he"" is the person who did not know Taylor, which is Alex. Therefore, it is most likely that Alex sent the letter.

But, we can't rule out the possibility that Taylor is the one who sent the letter. It's not entirely impossible that Taylor decided to send a letter to Alex to initiate contact.

So, the answer is: the sentence is ambiguous because both options (Alex sent the letter and Taylor sent the letter) are plausible.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""Alex did not know Taylor until...""
* ""...he sent a letter""

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to the one who performed the action of sending a letter. The sentence implies that Alex did not know Taylor until this event occurred.

The possibilities are:

* Alex did not know Taylor until Alex sent a letter (implausible, as Alex already didn't know Taylor)
* Alex did not know Taylor until Taylor sent a letter (more plausible, as this could be the event that allows Alex to meet or know Taylor)
* Alex did not know Taylor until someone (unnamed) sent a letter (ambiguous, as the sentence does not explicitly specify who sent the letter)

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is the architect.

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The student set up a meeting with the architect to review her blueprints.""

The pronoun in question is ""her"".

The antecedent of a pronoun is the noun or phrase that the pronoun refers to. In this case, the pronoun ""her"" refers to either ""the student"" or ""the architect"".

The sentence doesn't provide any additional information to disambiguate the referent of ""her"". Therefore, the antecedent of ""her"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either ""the student"" or ""the architect"".

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""the student"" is a subject, a noun phrase
* ""set up a meeting"" is a verb phrase, describing the student's action
* ""with the architect"" indicates who the student is meeting
* ""to review"" is a infinitive phrase, indicating the purpose of the meeting
* ""her blueprints"" is the object of the preposition ""to review"", referring to something belonging to someone

Now, we need to find the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"":
* ""her"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the blueprints belong to someone
* Since ""her"" is referring to something related to the review, it's likely that ""her"" refers to a person singular (the student or the architect) rather than a group or a thing
* Given that option (A) and (B) suggests a clear ownership (the student's or the architect's blueprints), the antecedent of ""her"" is likely to be one of these

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's analyze the sentence:

""After meeting with the producers, Sam went to his office.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"", we need to look for the noun that it refers to.

The pronoun ""his"" is in the phrase ""his office"". This phrase is describing the location where Sam goes.

The sentence doesn't explicitly state that the office belongs to the producers, and it also doesn't exclude the possibility that the office belongs to Sam.

Based on the context, it's reasonable to assume that the office refers to one that is familiar to Sam, which would make option (B) ""The office was Sam's office"" more likely. However, we cannot perfectly determine the correct antecedent from the sentence alone.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((C))
Let's break it down.

The sentence is: ""After meeting with the producers, Sam went to his office.""

The pronoun is ""his"". We need to find the antecedent, which is the thing that the pronoun refers to.

The antecedent is likely to be Sam, because Sam is a person and ""his office"" suggests a personal office, which is more likely to belong to Sam than the producers.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""After meeting with the producers, Sam went to his office.""

The pronoun is ""his"". We need to find the antecedent, which is the word or phrase that the pronoun refers to.

The options are:

(A) The office was the producers' office
(B) The office was Sam's office
(C) Ambiguous

The key here is to identify what ""his"" refers to. It can refer to either Sam or the producers, but not the office itself.

After meeting with the producers, the sentence shifts the focus to Sam. The possessive adjective ""his"" is likely referring to Sam, as it precedes his name and implies a sense of ownership or possession.

So, the answer is:

The sentence is: ""The construction worker called the editor and told him the whole story.""

* The sentence has two nouns: ""construction worker"" and ""editor"".
* The pronoun ""him"" appears in the second part of the sentence, ""and told him the whole story"".
* To determine what ""him"" refers to, we need to look at the context and prior information in the sentence.
* The sentence states that the construction worker called the editor, which implies that the editor is the person being called.
* Therefore, ""him"" most likely refers to the editor.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is the editor.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The construction worker called the editor and told him the whole story.""

The pronoun ""him"" refers to the person who received the action of the verb ""told"".

The sentence also mentions ""the construction worker"" and ""the editor"", which are the two people potentially receiving the action of the verb.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" can be either ""the construction worker"" or ""the editor"".

Since the sentence does not provide enough context to disambiguate, the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The construction worker called the editor and told him the whole story.""

First, we know that ""him"" is a pronoun referring to a person who was called.

Second, we see that the verb ""called"" is in the past tense, and it is followed by the phrase ""and told him..."". This suggests that the person who was called is the same person who was told something.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is the person who was called, which is the editor.

The sentence clearly indicates that ""they"" made a mistake. There are only two entities mentioned in the sentence, which are the developer and the secretary.

Since the sentence does not mention the developer making a mistake, and neither does it imply that the secretary is responsible, it implies that the developer made a mistake.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The developer met with the secretary because they made a mistake.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"", we need to identify the noun or pronoun that it refers back to.

In this sentence, the verb ""made a mistake"" is in the present tense, indicating that ""they"" is the subject that performed the action of making the mistake.

Looking at the sentence, we see that there are two options:

* The developer (who met with the secretary)
* The secretary (who met with the developer)

Since ""they"" is the subject that made the mistake, the antecedent is NOT the developer (because the developer is the one who met with the secretary, not the one who made the mistake).

Therefore, the antecedent is the secretary, as they are the one who made the mistake.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The developer met with the secretary because they made a mistake.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to someone who made a mistake. To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun or noun phrase that corresponds to ""they"".

In this sentence, we have two possible candidates:

* The developer
* The secretary

The developer is not likely to have made a mistake, as the sentence states that they met with the secretary because of the mistake.

On the other hand, the secretary is a likely candidate. The sentence implies that the mistake was made by someone who needs to be spoken to, and the developer is the one speaking to them. Therefore, it is more likely that the secretary made the mistake.

The sentence is: ""The educator was meeting with a student to discuss their grading policy.""

The pronoun is ""their"", and we need to find the antecedent, which is the noun or phrase that the pronoun refers to.

The options are:

* (A) It was the educator's grading policy
* (B) It was the student's grading policy
* (C) Ambiguous

Let's break it down:

* We know that ""student"" is a noun in the sentence, and it comes before the pronoun ""their"".
* We also know that ""educator"" is another noun in the sentence.
* The pronoun ""their"" is plural, and it refers to the grading policy.

Given the context and the grammatical structure of the sentence, it's clear that the grading policy belongs to both the educator and the student. They are discussing the policy together, which implies that it's a shared policy or a collaborative effort.

Since the policy belongs to both, option (B) ""It was the student's grading policy"" is incorrect, as the student alone does not own the policy.

Options (A) and (C) are still viable. (C) is incorrect because the sentence is not ambiguous; we can clearly see that the pronoun ""their"" refers to the grading policy.

The correct option is (A): ""It was the educator's grading policy"".
Let's break down the sentence and identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"".

* The sentence is about the educator meeting with a student to discuss their grading policy.
* The word ""their"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the grading policy belongs to something or someone.
* The only nouns mentioned in the sentence are ""educator"", ""student"", and ""grading policy"".
* The grading policy cannot belong to the educator, as it's the educator who is discussing it, so it's unlikely that the educator is the owner of the policy.
* Similarly, it's unlikely that the student owns the grading policy, as it's the educator who is discussing it with the student.
* Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either the educator or the student, but without more context, it's unclear.

Final Answer = (C)
Let's break down the sentence:

""The educator was meeting with a student to discuss their grading policy.""

The pronoun is ""their"", which refers to the grammatical subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is the phrase ""a student"".

The phrase ""a student"" is the object of the verb ""meeting"" and is describing who the educator is meeting with. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is the student, not the educator.

So, the antecedent of ""her"" is ""Sam"".

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to her office.""

The pronoun is ""her"", which is referring to something or someone.

The story so far is that Sam has met with the producers, but there is no indication that the producers have an office that Sam is going to.

The only clear candidate for ""her"" to refer to is Sam herself. If Sam is going to her office, it makes sense that she is going to her own office, not the producers' office.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence says: ""After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to her office.""

The pronoun ""her"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is Sam.

* The reason for the nurse's actions is ""because she smelled awful"".
* The pronoun ""she"" refers to the person who smelled awful, which is the reason for the nurse's action.

Analyzing the sentence, we can conclude that ""she"" refers to the laborer, not the nurse. The laborer is the one who smelled awful, and the nurse is running away because of it.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The nurse was running from the laborer because she smelled awful.""

The pronoun is ""she"", which refers to the antecedent.

As we read the sentence, the focus is on the nurse's action (running). Then, we learn the reason for her action (because she smelled awful).

The most logical antecedent for the pronoun ""she"" is the noun phrase immediately preceding ""because"" clause, which is ""the nurse"". This makes sense because the sentence implies that the nurse was running away from something (the laborer) because of something related to herself (she smelled awful).

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the ""nurse"".

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence step by step:

* The sentence is ""The nurse was running from the laborer because she smelled awful.""
* The pronoun is ""she"".
* The pronoun ""she"" is referring to the person who is doing the action described by the verb ""was running from"". This is the subject of the sentence.
* The subject of the sentence is either ""the nurse"" or ""the laborer"".

So, if we consider the options:

(A) The nurse smelled awful: This is a possible interpretation, as the nurse could be the one who smells awful and is running away from the laborer.

(B) The laborer smelled awful: This is also a possible interpretation, as the laborer could be the one who smells awful and the nurse is running away from them.

The sentence is: ""The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave them a blueprint.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"", we need to identify what the designer gave.

The designer collaborated with the carpenter (which means they worked together). The sentence uses the verb ""gave"" in the present tense, indicating that the designer is the one performing the action of giving.

Given the context, it implies that the designer gave the blueprint to the carpenter and themselves (the designer). Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"" is both the designer and the carpenter.

Since the sentence implies a joint recipient (the designer and the carpenter) for the blueprint, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave them a blueprint.""

The pronoun is ""them"", and we need to identify what it refers to.

Since there are two individuals mentioned in the sentence - the designer and the carpenter - we could potentially associate ""them"" with either one. However, look at the verb ""collaborated"". It implies that the designer and the carpenter were working together, suggesting that they were a joint entity. This implies that ""them"" refers to the combined entity of the designer and the carpenter.

Given this context, it's unlikely that ""them"" refers to the singular ""designer"" or ""carpenter"". Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave them a blueprint.

The pronoun is ""them"".

The pronoun ""them"" is an object, so it must refer to a previously mentioned noun or pronoun that is a subject or an object of the sentence.

The sentence mentions ""the designer"" and ""the carpenter"" as the subjects that are collaborating.

Since ""them"" is an object and ""the carpenter"" is a subject in the sentence, it is more likely that ""the carpenter"" is the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"".

The sentence states: ""The mechanic greets the receptionist because she was in a good mood.""

The pronoun ""she"" refers to the thing that is the reason why the mechanic greets the receptionist. In this case, ""she"" cannot refer to the mechanic, because the sentence doesn't indicate that the mechanic was in a good mood. Instead, it says ""the receptionist"" was in a good mood.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the receptionist.

Final Answer = ((B))
To identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"", we need to answer the question ""who was in a good mood?""

The sentence mentions ""the receptionist"" in the first clause, but it doesn't explicitly state that the receptionist was in a good mood. However, it does use ""because"" to indicate a reason for the mechanic greeting the receptionist, implying that the receptionist's being in a good mood is the reason.

Therefore, the most logical connection between the clauses is that it was the receptionist who was in a good mood.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The question is: What is the antecedent of the pronoun ""she""?

The sentence is: ""The mechanic greets the receptionist because she was in a good mood.""

The word ""she"" is a pronoun referring to a person who was in a good mood. Who is that person?

The sentence tells us that the receptionist is the person being greeted, but it doesn't state anything about the mechanic's mood. Therefore, it's likely that ""she"" refers to the receptionist, not the mechanic.

The sentence is: ""The chief encouraged the writer because they wrote a good book.""

We're looking for the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"". To find it, let's identify the nouns in the sentence:

* The chief
* The writer
* a good book

The pronoun ""they"" is used because of the verb ""wrote"", which is in the third person singular, indicating that the subject performing the action is not specified. This is where the ambiguity arises.

Option (A) ""The chief wrote a good book"" is not a possible antecedent because the chief is the one doing the encouraging, not the writing.

Option (B) ""The writer wrote a good book"" is possible because the writer might be the one who wrote the good book.

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The chief encouraged the writer because they wrote a good book.""

The pronoun is ""they"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify who or what ""they"" refers to.

The sentence has two nouns: ""the chief"" and ""the writer"". Both are potential candidates to be the antecedent of ""they"". However, the sentence structure suggests that the antecedent is more likely to be ""the writer"", as the reason for the chief's encouragement is that the writer wrote a good book.

The sentence is: The chief encouraged the writer because they wrote a good book.

To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun that ""they"" refers to.

The nouns in the sentence are: ""chief"" and ""writer"".

The sentence is structured as ""because they [did something]"", suggesting that ""they"" refers to the one who did the action.

The sentence is: ""The developer met with the designer because their idea can be implemented.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"", we need to look for the noun that the pronoun is referring to.

The two possible nouns are ""developer"" and ""designer"", because they are the only two nouns in the sentence that have a potential role-to-play in having an ""idea"".

* The sentence is because-clause, which means the dependent clause ""because their idea can be implemented"" is describing the reason why the subject (whoever met with whom) is doing something.
* Looking at the sentence, ""The developer met with the designer..."" suggests that one of them had an idea, and the other one is the one who can implement it.

""The mechanic disliked the cashier because she is arrogant.""

We need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"". The pronoun ""she"" is referring to the person whose property or characteristic is being described (in this case, being arrogant).

The subject of the sentence is ""The mechanic"", and it's not possible for a mechanic to be arrogant in the same sense that a cashier can be arrogant. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" is likely referring to the cashier.

The correct answer is:

Final Answer ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The mechanic disliked the cashier because she is arrogant.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"", we need to look back at the sentence and identify the noun that refers to the same entity as ""she"".

The sentence starts with ""The mechanic disliked the cashier..."". Here, ""the mechanic"" and ""the cashier"" are two separate nouns.

The pronoun ""she"" is introduced as the subject of the relative clause ""because she is arrogant"". This means that the antecedent of ""she"" is the person who is being described as arrogant in the relative clause.

In this sentence, ""the cashier"" is the one being described as arrogant, not ""the mechanic"". Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The mechanic disliked the cashier because she is arrogant.""

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to someone in the sentence. To determine what ""she"" refers to, we need to look back at the sentence and identify the noun phrases.

We have two noun phrases:

* ""the mechanic""
* ""the cashier""

The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the mechanic's dislike is that the cashier is arrogant. Therefore, the most likely antecedent for ""she"" is the noun phrase ""the cashier"".",((C)),387,385

The sentence is: ""The developer met with the secretary because he made a mistake.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

To find the antecedent, we need to identify what ""he"" refers to.

The subject of the sentence is ""The developer"". It's the one meeting with the secretary.

The second part of the sentence is the reason why they met (""because...""), which is ""he made a mistake"".

Now, we need to choose an option that links the ""he"" in ""made a mistake"" to either ""The developer"" or ""The secretary"".

Since ""he"" is closer to ""The developer"" in the sentence, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to ""The developer"".

So, the correct answer is:

Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The developer met with the secretary because he made a mistake.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

To find the antecedent, we need to identify what the pronoun ""he"" is referring to in the sentence.

The options are:

A) The developer
B) The secretary
C) Ambiguous

Since ""he"" is used as a general pronoun, it is not explicitly stated that it refers to either the developer or the secretary. However, based on the context, it is more likely that ""he"" refers to the developer, as the sentence suggests that the developer made a mistake and that's why they met with the secretary.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The developer met with the secretary because he made a mistake.""

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to the person who made a mistake.

The sentence implies that the developer is not the one who made a mistake, otherwise it would not say ""because he made a mistake"", implying that someone else made the mistake.

The sentence is: ""The mechanic called to inform the customer that their car would be ready in the morning.""

In this sentence, ""their"" refers to the noun that the verb ""would be ready"" is describing. In other words, ""their car"" is the thing that will be ready in the morning.

Now, look at the options:

(A) It was the mechanic's car
(B) It was the customer's car
(C) Ambiguous

The sentence does not mention anything about the mechanic having a car, so option (A) is unlikely. On the other hand, the sentence directly mentions that the customer's car is being discussed.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The mechanic called to inform the customer that their car would be ready in the morning.""

The pronoun is ""their"".

* ""Their"" is a possessive pronoun, meaning it shows ownership.
* It agrees with a noun that is closer to it, which can be either a singular or plural noun.
* In this sentence, ""their"" does not agree with ""mechanic"", because ""mechanic"" is a singular noun.

This means that ""their"" must agree with the noun ""customer"", which is a singular noun. Therefore, ""their car"" refers to the customer's car.

So, the antecedent of ""their"" is ""(B) It was the customer's car"".

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break it down:

* The sentence is: ""The mechanic called to inform the customer that their car would be ready in the morning.""
* The pronoun is ""their"".
* The pronoun ""their"" is referring to the owner of the car.
* The person/thing that own the car is the one to whom the mechanic is speaking, which is the customer (as stated in the sentence).
* Therefore, the car belongs to the customer.

""The reporter and the chef discuss her favorite dishes.""

The pronoun is ""her"", and we need to find its antecedent, which is the noun that it replaces.

The nouns in the sentence are ""reporter"" and ""chef"". Since both are singular and are being referred to in the same sentence, we can consider the possibility that the pronoun ""her"" refers to either of them.

However, in English, it's more common for a singular antecedent to refer to a person or a human, whereas a non-human entity (like a profession, place, etc.) is more likely to be referred to using a neuter or plural pronoun.

Given this, it's more likely that the pronoun ""her"" refers to the reporter, as ""reporter"" is a job title associated with a person.

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The reporter and the chef discuss her favorite dishes.""

The pronoun ""her"" refers to the closer noun to the pronoun, which is a female noun. Since ""reporter"" and ""chef"" are both singular nouns, one of them must be a female noun. We don't know the gender of either the reporter or the chef, but we can still make an educated guess.

The use of definite article ""the"" before ""reporter"" suggests that the reporter is a specific, already mentioned or previously established individual. In many cases, a specific reporter might be a woman. On the other hand, ""chef"" is a more neutral term and can refer to either gender.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the pronoun ""her"" likely refers to the chef, as the use of ""the"" before ""reporter"" might indicate a female reporter, and the sentence doesn't provide enough information to prove the reporter is male.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The reporter and the chef discuss her favorite dishes.""

The pronoun ""her"" is referring to a person, and we need to find out who that person is.

The sentence says ""The reporter and the chef discuss..."", which means two people are discussing something. The sentence does not specify which one of the two people (the reporter or the chef) is the one whose favorite dishes are being discussed.

Since the sentence does not provide enough information to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"", it is ambiguous.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""Before they sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor.""

The pronoun we're interested in is ""they"". The question is what antecedent does ""they"" refer to.

The phrase ""before they sent the letter"" is modifying the time when something happened. So, ""they"" must refer to the person(s) who sent the letter.

The sentence doesn't explicitly state who sent the letter, but the word order suggests that ""they"" might refer back to ""Alex"". This is because ""Alex"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""they"" is the subject of the clause ""before they sent the letter"". This creates a possible ambiguity.

However, we can resolve the ambiguity by looking at the sentence as a whole. If ""they"" referred to Alex, it would be awkward to say that Alex did not know Taylor before Alex sent the letter, because Alex wouldn't have sent the letter if they didn't know Taylor.

A more natural interpretation is that ""they"" refers to a different entity, which is not specified in the sentence. Therefore, the antecedent of ""they"" is not explicitly stated.

Final Answer = (C).
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""Before they sent the letter"" introduces a time period where something happened before the action of sending the letter.
* ""Alex did not know Taylor"" is a statement about Alex's knowledge of Taylor.

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to the subject of the clause ""Before they sent the letter"", which is not explicitly stated. However, the sentence assumes that ""they"" is the same person or entity that sent the letter (since ""Before they sent the letter"" implies a causal relationship between the action of sending the letter and the state of Alex's knowledge).

Based on this analysis, the most likely antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the subject that performed the action of sending the letter. Therefore, I would argue that:

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence step by step.

The sentence is: ""Before they sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor.""

The pronoun ""they"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is ""Alex"" and ""Taylor"". It is plural, indicating that both Alex and Taylor performed the action of sending the letter.

Since the sentence does not indicate which one of them sent the letter, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous. Both Alex and Taylor could have sent the letter.

Since the sentence doesn't explicitly specify who is being referred to by ""her"", it's possible to interpret it as either the designer or the carpenter.

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's analyze the sentence:

* ""The designer collaborated with the carpenter..."" - This part of the sentence suggests a joint action between the designer and the carpenter.
* ""...and gave her a blueprint..."" - Here, the pronoun ""her"" is used to refer to the person who received the blueprint.

Given the context, the most likely antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the person who collaborated with the designer, which is the carpenter. It is more natural to assume that the carpenter received the blueprint as a result of the collaboration, rather than the designer receiving a blueprint.

The sentence is: ""The designer called the janitor and asked her to clean the room.""

The pronoun is ""her"". We need to find what she refers to.

The sentence starts with ""The designer called the janitor"". This means that the designer did the calling, and the janitor received the call.

The verb ""asked"" follows, and it's a protasis ( introducing the request or requirement).

The pronoun ""her"" is the object of the verb ""asked"". It refers to the one who was called, i.e. the janitor.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = (B)
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The designer called the janitor and asked her to clean the room.""

The pronoun ""her"" is referring to the subject of the sentence, which is the one performing the action ""asked"". The options are:

(A) Asked the designer: This would mean the designer asked the janitor to clean the room, but the designer is the one calling the janitor, so this doesn't make sense.

(B) Asked the janitor: This would mean the janitor asked the janitor to clean the room, which doesn't make sense at all.

(C) Ambiguous: This sentence is ambiguous because the subject ""her"" could refer to either the designer or the janitor. The designer called the janitor and then asked the janitor to do something, or the designer asked the janitor to do something, and the janitor said ""her"" (implying the designer to do it). Both readings make sense, but the sentence doesn't provide enough context to disambiguate.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The designer called the janitor and asked her to clean the room.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"", we need to identify the subject that the verb ""asked"" is referring to.

The sentence structure is: ""The designer called the janitor and asked ..."".

The verb ""called"" has two objects: ""the designer"" (the one doing the calling) and ""the janitor"" (the one being called). The sentence is saying that the designer called the janitor.

The verb ""asked"" is then connected to the verb ""called"" using the word ""and"". This indicates that the action of asking is happening as a result of the action of calling.

So, the pronoun ""her"" is referring to the subject of the verb ""asked"", which is the same subject as the verb ""called"" - the janitor. The janitor is the one being asked to clean the room.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the janitor.

The sentence is describing an action performed by someone, and we need to figure out who that someone is.

The phrase ""the technician"" is the subject of the sentence before the pronoun, and it's describing the person who told the customer something.

* It's likely that the paralegal's action was the cause of the firing, since they forgot to file the paperwork, and if the paperwork wasn't filed, the client wouldn't have trusted the paralegal to do their job properly.

The sentence structure is: ""The physician told X that he Y"". Here, ""he"" is the subject pronoun, and ""he had cancer"" is the predicate.

The possible antecedents are the physician or the baker. However, the pronoun ""he"" is closer to the baker, as the sentence is structured to show the baker as the recipient of the information ""that he had cancer"". This suggests that the pronoun ""he"" likely refers to the baker.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Let's analyze the sentence.

The sentence is: ""The physician told the baker that he had cancer.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

To determine the antecedent, we need to find the noun or pronoun that ""he"" refers to.

In this sentence, ""he"" is in the predicate nominative position, which means it's the direct object of the verb ""told"".

The verb ""told"" takes a direct object, which is a clause starting with ""that"". The pronoun ""he"" is within that clause.

So, ""he"" refers to the subject of that clause, which is ""that"".

Since ""that"" doesn't refer to a specific noun, but rather introduces a clause, the pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous. It could refer to either the physician or the baker, but it's not clear which one.

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The physician told the baker that he had cancer.""

We need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

The sentence says ""that he had cancer"", which means the pronoun ""he"" is referring to someone about whom something is being said (i.e., the person who has cancer).

The sentence also says ""The physician told the baker"", which means the physician is the one doing the telling, and the baker is the one being told.

Now, who is the person about whom the physician is saying ""he has cancer""?

It could be either the physician or the baker. If we substitute the baker's name in, it becomes ""The physician told the baker that the baker had cancer"", which doesn't sound quite right. But if we substitute the physician's name in, it becomes ""The physician told the baker that the physician had cancer"", which still sounds a bit awkward, but it's grammatically correct.

(C) Ambiguous

Now, let's analyze the sentence:

* ""the patient"" is the subject of the sentence, and it's the one who disclosed something.
* ""the counselor"" is the object of the preposition ""to"", and it's the one who received the disclosure.

The verb ""disclosed"" is in the active voice, and it's describing the patient's action. Therefore, it's the patient who has the attribute ""had a history of substance abuse"".

So, the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the patient"".
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The patient disclosed to the counselor that they had a history of substance abuse.""

The pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to the subject of the sentence. The subject is ""that"" (which is a pronoun referring to an antecedent), and the antecedent of ""that"" is the object of the sentence, which is the phrase ""a history of substance abuse"".

So, ""they"" refers to ""a history of substance abuse"", not to the patient or the counselor. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((A)).
Let's break it down!

The pronoun ""they"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is the one performing the action of disclosing. In this case, the subject is ""the patient"".

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is ""the patient"".

Sentence: The secretary came to the analyst's office and helped her to book a flight.
Options:
(A) Helped the secretary book a flight
(B) Helped the analyst book a flight
(C) Ambiguous
End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down.

We have a sentence with a pronoun ""her"" that refers to someone in the sentence.

The sentence is: ""The secretary came to the analyst's office and helped her to book a flight.""

We need to identify what ""her"" refers to.

From the sentence, it is clear that there are two individuals mentioned: the secretary and the analyst.

Now let's think about the actions in the sentence. The secretary came to the analyst's office and helped... someone to book a flight.

It's more likely that the secretary helped the analyst, considering the context - the analyst has an office, and the secretary is helping the analyst with something (booking a flight). If the secretary were booking a flight, it wouldn't make sense in this context, as there is no need for the analyst's office.

So, Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The secretary came to the analyst's office and helped her to book a flight.""

We need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"".

The subject of the sentence is ""the secretary"", and the sentence mentions an ""analyst's office"". This suggests that the analyst is someone related to the office.

The verb ""came"" suggests that the secretary visited the office, and the verb ""helped"" is the action she took while she was there.

The pronoun ""her"" is likely referring to the person who is the recipient of the action ""to book a flight"". Since the secretary and the analyst are both mentioned, it's possible that the pronoun could refer to either one.

However, in a typical office setting, it's more likely that the analyst is the person who needs to book a flight (perhaps for a work-related trip), rather than the secretary.

Therefore,

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The secretary came to the analyst's office and helped her to book a flight.""

The pronoun ""her"" is referring to a person, and we need to find the antecedent to determine who that person is.

The antecedent is the subject of the sentence, which is ""the secretary"". However, ""the secretary"" is not the one performing the action of booking a flight. Instead, the sentence states that someone is helping ""her"" to book a flight.

The natural reading of the sentence is that the analyst is the one who is getting help to book a flight. The secretary is helping the analyst, so the antecedent of ""her"" is the analyst.

The sentence is: ""The cleaner called the guard and asked her to open the door.""

The pronoun is ""her"".

The options are:

(A) Asked the cleaner
(B) Asked the guard
(C) Ambiguous

Who did she ask to open the door?

Well, the sentence mentions that the cleaner called the guard, so it's likely that the cleaner asked the guard to open the door. The guard is the one who was called and asked to perform the action.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the guard.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The cleaner called the guard and asked her to open the door.""

The pronoun ""her"" is referring to the same person that the verb ""asked"" is acting on.

The sentence ""asked ... to open the door"" describes the action performed by the one being asked. Therefore, the verb ""asked"" is acting on the guard, not the cleaner.

So, the correct antecedent for the pronoun ""her"" is the guard.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The cleaner called the guard and asked her to open the door.""

The pronoun ""her"" is used to refer to someone. To find the antecedent, let's look at the sentence and identify the nouns and their corresponding pronouns:

* The cleaner (subject)
* The guard (object of the first clause)
* Her (pronoun, unknown antecedent)

The word ""her"" can refer to either ""the cleaner"" or ""the guard"", as both are female. The sentence doesn't provide enough context to disambiguate the antecedent, making it ambiguous.

* ""The physician told the baker..."" mentions a speaker (the physician) and a listener (the baker).
* ""...that they had cancer."" is a dependent clause that provides information about what the physician told the baker.

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to the subject of the main clause, which is ""the physician"" or ""the baker"". If ""they"" refers to ""the physician"", it implies that the physician told the baker that the physician had cancer, which doesn't make sense. If ""they"" refers to ""the baker"", it implies that the physician told the baker that the baker had cancer, which is a possible interpretation.

Since the sentence doesn't provide enough context to disambiguate the antecedent, we can conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The physician told the baker that they had cancer.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to someone that the sentence mentions earlier. The candidate antecedents are ""the physician"" and ""the baker"".

The phrase ""they had cancer"" is in the passive voice, which means that the subject of the sentence is receiving the action of the verb ""had cancer"", rather than performing the action.

Since it is unlikely that a physician would be telling a baker that they (the physician) have cancer, and it is more plausible that a physician might tell a baker that they (the person being examined) have cancer, we can infer that ""they"" is likely referring to the patient being examined by the physician.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The physician told the baker that they had cancer.""

The pronoun is ""they"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify the noun that ""they"" refers to.

The sentence states that ""the physician told the baker"", so it is not a physician's condition being referred to (A).

The sentence also states that ""they had cancer"", but who is ""they""? It could be either the physician (B) or the baker (C).

Since the sentence does not provide further information to disambiguate the pronoun, we are left with two possible antecedents. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The sentence is: ""My cousin called her boss for more information""

The pronoun ""her"" is referring to someone or something, but who or what is not explicitly stated in the sentence. However, we can make an educated guess by looking at the context.

The subject of the sentence is ""my cousin"", who is the one performing the action of calling someone. The action of calling is directed towards a target, which is the ""boss"". The pronoun ""her"" is likely referring to the boss, as ""her"" is a possessive pronoun indicating that the boss is a woman.

Based on this analysis, the most likely antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the boss.

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""My cousin called her boss for more information""

The pronoun is ""her"", and the question is what it refers to.

The sentence does not provide additional information about the boss's relationship to the cousin, unlike the options provided.

Since the sentence does not provide enough context, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either the boss's gender (male or female) or the cousin's relationship to the boss (e.g., being employed by the boss, being a subordinate, etc.).

Therefore, the correct answer would be:

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""My cousin called her boss for more information""

The pronoun is ""her"", which refers to... ?

The possibilities are:

* ""her"" refers to ""my cousin"" (i.e., the cousin is a female who called a boss)
* ""her"" refers to ""the boss"" (i.e., the boss is a female)

""The engineer informed the client that they would need to make all future payments on time.""

The pronoun ""they"" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is:

* ""client"" (direct object of ""informed"")

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the client.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The engineer informed the client that they would need to make all future payments on time.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to an entity that needs to make the future payments. In order to determine what this entity is, we need to look at the sentence structure.

The sentence starts by saying ""The engineer informed the client..."". This implies that the engineer is communicating some information to the client. What follows is a dependent clause ""that they would need to make all future payments on time"".

The clause ""that they would need... "" is a relative clause, which is describing an entity that needs to make payments. The pronoun ""they"" in this clause is referring to the entity that needs to make payments.

In this context, it is clear that the entity they is referring to is the client, because the sentence states that the engineer is informing the client that they need to make payments.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the client.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence step by step:

""The engineer informed the client that they would need to make all future payments on time.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

Who is referred to by the pronoun ""they""?

The sentence says ""the engineer informed the client"", which implies that the engineer is speaking to the client.

So, the pronoun ""they"" is likely referring to the person or entity that needs to make the payments, which is the client.

""The nurse stayed away from the laborer because they were very busy.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referred to as ""antecedent"" and it needs to be clearly linked to a noun or a phrase in the sentence.

In this sentence, the options are:

* (A) The nurse was busy: The nurse is the subject of the sentence, but it doesn't make sense for the nurse to be the one who is busy.
* (B) The laborer was busy: The laborer is the object of the sentence, and it does make sense for the laborer to be the one who is busy. The sentence implies that the nurse stayed away from the laborer due to the laborer's busy schedule.
* (C) Ambiguous: This option is not correct because the sentence clearly indicates that the laborer is the one who is busy.

Based on the sentence's meaning and structure, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The nurse stayed away from the laborer because they were very busy.""

* ""they"" is the pronoun
* ""were very busy"" is the clause it refers to

The question is, what is the antecedent of ""they""? In other words, what or whom do ""they"" refer to?

The sentence suggests a reason for the nurse's action (staying away), which is that the nurse (or someone) was busy. The word ""because"" indicates a causal relationship, implying that the nurse's busy-ness is the reason for staying away.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the subject ""the nurse"".

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The nurse stayed away from the laborer because they were very busy.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"", we need to identify the noun or phrase that the pronoun refers to.

The options are:

* (A) The nurse
* (B) The laborer
* (C) Ambiguous

The subject of the sentence is the nurse. The verb ""stayed away"" indicates that the nurse took some action, but didn't specify what. The clause ""because they were very busy"" provides a reason for why the nurse stayed away.

Now, let's look at the pronoun ""they"". Who or what were very busy?

The context suggests that it's not the nurse who was busy, because the nurse stayed away from the laborer. Therefore, it's more likely that the laborer was the one who was busy.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((C)). (Ambiguous)

Note: Although the answer is ""Ambiguous"", it's not entirely ambiguous because we can deduce the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" to be ""the undergraduate"". However, it's not explicitly clear in the sentence.
Let's analyze the sentence step by step.

The pronoun is ""she"", which refers to a noun (antecedent) in the sentence.

The sentence states ""The undergraduate applied to work with the scientist because [reason]"". The reason is ""she needed a lab assistant"".

This implies that the person referred to by ""she"" is not the undergraduate, because the undergraduate is the one doing the applying. Therefore, ""she"" must refer to the scientist, who the undergraduate wants to work with.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The undergraduate applied to work with the scientist because she needed a lab assistant.""

The pronoun is ""she"". To find the antecedent of ""she"", we need to look for the noun or noun phrase in the sentence that it replaces.

The options provided are:

(A) The undergraduate needed an assistant
(B) The scientist needed an assistant

Let's analyze the sentence:

* ""The undergraduate"" is a noun phrase, but it's the one who is applying, not who needs an assistant.
* ""The scientist"" is a noun phrase, and it's the one who is being applied to work with, but it's not the one who needs an assistant.

To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun that the pronoun refers to.

Here are the nouns in the sentence:

* The worker
* the pedestrian

One of these nouns must be the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"". But which one?

The pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the clause ""was repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible"". This clause is describing the action that the worker is doing, not the pedestrian.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is:

Final Answer ((A)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The worker told the pedestrian that she was repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible.""

The pronoun is ""she"", and we need to find out what it refers to.

The options are:

(A) The worker was repairing
(B) The pedestrian was repairing
(C) Ambiguous

Let's analyze the sentence:

* ""The worker"" is a subject, and ""told"" is an action they performed.
* ""The pedestrian"" is the object of the action, receiving the information from the worker.
* ""that she was repairing the sidewalk as quickly as possible"" is a subordinate clause, providing additional information about what the worker told the pedestrian.

Now, considering the pronoun ""she"", we see that it is describing the subject of the subordinate clause, which is the one performing the action of repairing the sidewalk.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is... the worker!

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down.

In the sentence, the pronoun ""she"" is referring to a noun. The noun could be either ""the worker"" or ""the pedestrian"".

The sentence implies that the worker is the one repairing the sidewalk, as it says ""the worker told the pedestrian"". If the worker was not the one repairing, it would be quite strange for the worker to tell someone else that they are repairing something.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is most likely ""the worker"".

If we look at the options:

(A) Asked if the assistant could borrow money: This is not correct because the sentence mentions asking the physician, not the assistant.

(B) Asked if the physician could borrow money: This is correct because the sentence implies that the physician is being asked if they can borrow some money.

(B) The child would have to mop
(C) Ambiguous
End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down:

1. We have the sentence: ""The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise he would have to mop it all over again.""
2. The key phrase is ""he would have to mop it all over again.""
3. The pronoun ""he"" is referring to someone who would have to mop.

Now, let's consider the options:

* (A) The janitor would have to mop: This is the best option because the janitor is the one who would have to mop the floor, not the child. The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, and if the child does, the janitor would have to mop it again.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise he would have to mop it all over again.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

* The first candidate for the antecedent of ""he"" is the janitor, because the subject of the sentence is the janitor who is warning the child.
* However, if we replace ""he"" with the janitor in the sentence, it doesn't sound right: ""The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise the janitor would have to mop it all over again."" The error is that the janitor is warning about having to mop, not doing something directly in the present.
* The second candidate for the antecedent of ""he"" is the person who has to mop, implying the child. But this doesn't make sense either, because the child is being warned not to step on the floor, not to mop it.

So, the antecedent of ""he"" is neither the janitor nor the child. It's actually the person who would have to mop, which in this case is the janitor, but only in the hypothetical scenario where the child steps on the floor.

Final Answer = (C).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise he would have to mop it all over again.""

We want to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

The sentence starts with ""The janitor warned..."". So, ""the janitor"" is the subject performing the action of warning.

The clause ""the child not to step on the wet floor"" is a dependent clause, indicating what not to do.

Then comes the conditional clause ""otherwise he would have to mop it all over again"".

The pronoun ""he"" is not referring to the child (because the child is the one who is being warned not to step on the floor). Nor is it referring to ""the wet floor"" or ""the step"" because those are not the ones performing the action of mopping.

So, the pronoun ""he"" is referring back to the original subject ""the janitor"".

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the ""janitor"".

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to the person who is described as being ""very busy"". Since we're considering the options, we can try to match the pronoun to each option:

* (A) The nurse was busy: The pronoun ""she"" is not referring to the nurse, as it's stated that the nurse stayed away due to being busy. So, this option doesn't fit.
* (B) The laborer was busy: We're left with this option. The laborer is the person who the nurse stayed away from, so the sentence makes sense if we say that she, referring to the laborer, was very busy. This is a possible interpretation.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is indeed the laborer.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's examine the sentence:

""The nurse stayed away from the laborer because she was very busy.""

The pronoun ""she"" refers to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is a nurse. Therefore, ""she"" refers to the nurse.

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The nurse stayed away from the laborer because she was very busy.""

The pronoun ""she"" is the part we need to find the antecedent for.

The sentence says ""she was very busy"". So, we need to look for a noun in the sentence that refers to a female, and that noun is ""nurse"" (it's a female noun). 

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ""the nurse"".

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to a person mentioned in the sentence. The person being referred to is the one who needs to get more rest. This is not ambiguous, as it is clear that the patient is the one who needs more rest, not the surgeon.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The surgeon warned the patient that she needed to get more rest.""

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to the thing that needed to get more rest.

The options are:

(A) The surgeon needed more rest
(B) The patient needed more rest
(C) Ambiguous

The surgeon is the one doing the warning, not the one needing rest. The patient is the one who needs rest.

So, the answer is: the patient needs more rest.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The surgeon warned the patient that she needed to get more rest.""

The pronoun is ""she"", which refers to the noun that follows the antecedent. In this case, the antecedent is the thing that the pronoun ""she"" replaces.

We can identify the antecedent by looking for the noun that is most closely related to the verb ""needed"". In this sentence, ""the patient"" is the one who needs more rest, so the antecedent is likely ""the patient"".

* ""The reporter and the chef"" are the two individuals mentioned in the sentence.
* ""will discuss"" is the action they will perform.
* ""his favorite dishes"" is the topic of discussion.

The pronoun ""his"" refers to a noun that is possessed, meaning it belongs to one of the individuals mentioned in the sentence. The options are:

* The reporter
* The chef

Since both the reporter and the chef are male (the pronoun ""his"" implies a male possession), we can't determine a single antecedent based on gender. However, in a sentence with multiple antecedents, the closest antecedent is usually the one that is most closely associated with the action (in this case, discussing).

In this sentence, the action of discussing is directly related to the chef, as the term ""favorite dishes"" is more commonly associated with a chef's expertise and personal opinion. Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" is more likely to refer to the chef.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The reporter and the chef will discuss his favorite dishes.""

The pronoun ""his"" is the one we're interested in.

The pronoun ""his"" clearly refers to a male noun, but which one?

The sentence has two nouns: ""the reporter"" and ""the chef"". Both are masculine.

So, we have a plural subject (""the reporter and the chef""), but a singular pronoun (""his""). This implies that the pronoun ""his"" must refer to one of the two nouns, but the sentence doesn't give us enough information to determine which one.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The reporter and the chef will discuss his favorite dishes.""

The pronoun is ""his"".

The phrase ""The reporter and the chef"" is a compound subject, meaning it consists of two nouns (reporter and chef) connected by ""and"".

When we look at the sentence, we can see that ""his"" is embedded in the phrase ""his favorite dishes"", which is the direct object of the verb ""discuss"".

In this context, ""his"" clearly refers to the subject of the sentence, which is either the reporter or the chef. However, it cannot refer to ""they"" (the compound subject) because ""they"" is plural and ""his"" is a singular possessive pronoun.

Therefore, the only possibilities for the antecedent of ""his"" are the two individual subjects: the reporter or the chef.

Option (A) ""They will discuss the reporter's favorite dishes"" is incorrect because ""they"" is a plural subject, and ""his"" is a singular possessive pronoun.

Option (B) ""They will discuss the chef's favorite dishes"" is also incorrect because the sentence is referring to one person's favorite dishes, not both.

The word ""she"" refers to a person or entity that is making payments. The recipients of the information are the ones who would need to make payments on time. The sentence implies that the client, not the engineer, is the one who would need to make payments.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break it down:

* ""The engineer informed the client"" introduces two entities: the engineer and the client.
* ""that she"" refers to one of these entities. The subject of the infinitive phrase ""would need to make all future payments on time"" is ""she"".
* Given the context, ""she"" is more likely to be the client rather than the engineer, since the engineer is the one informing the client.
* Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the client.

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break it down:

The sentence is ""The engineer informed the client that she would need to make all future payments on time.""

The pronoun is ""she"".

To find the antecedent, we need to look back in the sentence to find the noun that ""she"" refers to. In this case, it's ""the client"" (also referred to as the subject of the sentence).

(C) Ambiguous

Let's analyze the sentence: ""After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to his office.""

The sentence indicates that after meeting with the producers, Sam is going somewhere. The phrase ""his office"" is the destination.

The antecedent of ""his"" is the noun that is associated with the possessive pronoun ""his"". In this sentence, it can only refer to one person who has an office. Sam is the only person mentioned in the sentence as going somewhere. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that ""his"" refers to Sam.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to his office.""

The pronoun is ""his"", which refers to a noun in the sentence.

The possible nouns are:

* Sam (possessive suffix '-s' indicates possession by Sam)
* the producers (possessive suffix '-s' would imply a plural possessive, but there is no such noun in the sentence)

Since Sam is the only logical referent for the pronoun ""his"", we can confidently say that the antecedent of the pronoun is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break down the sentence:

""After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to his office.""

The pronoun is ""his"". To determine the antecedent, we need to ask what ""his"" refers to.

The sentence uses a compound sentence structure: ""After meeting with the producers, Sam..."". The meeting is mentioned as an action that happened before Sam goes to his office. This implies that Sam is the one who met with the producers.

In this context, ""his"" is likely referring to Sam's office, as it is Sam who is going to his office.

""The supervisor gave the employee feedback on her stellar performance.""

The pronoun ""her"" is referring to the subject of the sentence, which is the entity that is having its performance evaluated. The subject of the sentence is not the supervisor, but rather the employee. The employee is the one who is having their performance evaluated with the phrase ""stellar performance"".

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is:

(B) It was the employee's performance

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The supervisor gave the employee feedback on her stellar performance.""

The pronoun is ""her"". To find the antecedent, we need to look back and find the noun that the pronoun refers to.

The closest noun is ""employee"", but it's a male noun, and ""her"" is a feminine pronoun. This is an inconsistency, but it's not the main issue here.

The issue is that ""her"" could refer to the ""supervisor"" as well, since the supervisor is the one giving the feedback.

So, we can't pinpoint a single correct antecedent. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break it down!

In the sentence ""The supervisor gave the employee feedback on her stellar performance."", the pronoun ""her"" refers to the thing being described as ""stellar"". The question is, what is being described as ""stellar""?

The nearby noun ""performance"" is the most likely candidate to be described as ""stellar"". Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the performance, which belongs to the employee (since ""the employee"" is the one receiving feedback on their performance).

The pronoun ""they"" refers to:

* The subject of the clause ""because they focus on code"". In this clause, ""they"" is the subject performing the action of focusing.

The antecedent of ""they"" is therefore the closest group of nouns that functions as the subject of the clause, which is ""the developer and the writer"" (they are both unable to communicate).

The sentence does not indicate which of these individuals is focusing on code, so we cannot determine whether it is the developer or the writer. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because they focus on code.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to the one who is unable to communicate with the writer, which is the developer or the writer.

So, the correct answer is (B) The writer focuses on code, because the sentence implies that the writer is the one who focuses on code, and that's the reason the developer can't communicate with them.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because they focus on code.""

The pronoun ""they"" appears in the sentence.

""To find the antecedent of the pronoun, we need to identify what the sentence is referring to. We can start by looking at the surrounding context and identifying the subjects of the sentence.""

The sentence has two subjects: ""the developer"" and ""the writer"". The sentence structure implies that the sentence is describing a reason why the developer is unable to communicate with the writer.

""The word 'because' is a subordinating conjunction, which introduces a dependent clause that provides a reason for the main clause. The dependent clause starts with 'they focus on code'.""

Now, considering the sentence structure and the word ""because"", it's clear that ""they"" refers to ""the developer"" and ""the writer"" together, as a group, because they cannot communicate effectively. It's unlikely that only one of the two individuals is focusing on code to the exclusion of the other.

* The sentence is ""The assistant asked the physician if she could borrow some money.""
* The pronoun is ""she"".
* The question is who (or what) is referred to by ""she"".

The pronoun ""their"" refers to the noun that is closest to it, which is ""blueprints"". Since ""blueprints"" is the object that is being reviewed, the antecedent of ""their"" is the person or entity that owns or possesses the blueprints.

The sentence implies that the student and the architect are discussing the blueprints together, but it doesn't explicitly state who owns or has control over the blueprints.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""their"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either the student or the architect. 

Final Answer = ((C))

The sentence is: ""The student set up a meeting with the architect to review their blueprints.""

The pronoun is ""their"".

To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun that ""their"" replaces. The possibilities are:

* The student: But the sentence is ""review their blueprints"", so it can't be referring to the student (it's talking about blueprints, not the student).
* The architect: But the sentence is ""review their blueprints"", so it can't be referring to the architect (it's talking about blueprints, not the architect's person).

However, if we consider both the student and the architect, we can infer that the blueprints might belong to either one of them. This is because the student is setting up a meeting with the architect to review the blueprints, which implies that the blueprints are being reviewed, potentially for a project or a building designed by one of them.

The antecedent is the possessor of the office, i.e. the person who owns the office.

The phrase ""the producers"" refers to multiple people, but they don't own an office. Sam is the one going to the office, but he might not own the office either.

So, the antecedent is not clearly specified.

Final Answer = (C).
Let's break it down step by step!

In the sentence ""After meeting with the producers, Sam will go to his office"", the pronoun ""his"" is referring to a noun that is close to it. The closest noun is ""office"".

Now, ""office"" is a noun that can be possessive, meaning it can belong to someone or something. We have two options: the producers' office or Sam's office.

Since Sam is the one who is going to the office, it makes more sense for the pronoun ""his"" to refer to Sam, not the producers. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The sentence is: ""My parent called her secretary for more information""

The pronoun is ""her"". We need to figure out what it refers to.

The subject of the sentence is ""My parent"", which is a singular noun. Therefore, ""her"" is likely referring to the parent.

In that case, the sentence implies that the parent is a female, and the pronoun ""her"" is identifying the secretary as the parent's secretary.

So, the correct option is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break down the sentence:

""My parent called her secretary for more information""

The pronoun is ""her"", which refers to...?

The subject of the sentence is ""my parent"", which is a singular noun. Therefore, the antecedent of ""her"" must be a singular noun as well.

Option (A) says ""They were my parent's secretary"", which implies that ""my parent"" has a secretary, and that ""they"" refers to that secretary. However, ""they"" is a plural pronoun, but ""my parent"" is singular. This option doesn't match the antecedent.

Option (B) says ""They were the secretary's secretary"", which implies that ""her"" refers to a secretary who has another secretary. This option also doesn't work, as ""my parent"" is the one calling someone, not a secretary having a secretary.

Given the sentence structure and the fact that ""my parent"" is singular, the only possible antecedent for ""her"" is... ""my parent"" itself. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = (C)
Let's analyze the sentence ""My parent called her secretary for more information"".

The pronoun ""her"" refers to either ""my parent"" or ""the secretary"". 

The sentence does not provide any additional information to uniquely determine the antecedent of ""her"". Therefore, the antecedent is ambiguous.

""The guard called the cleaner and asked her to open the door.""

The sentence mentions two people: the guard and the cleaner. The pronoun ""her"" is used to refer to one of them.

The verb ""called"" is in the past tense, which suggests that it was the guard who initiated the call.

The verb ""asked"" is also in the past tense, and it follows the subject ""the guard"", implying that the guard is the one doing the asking.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the cleaner, as she is the one being asked to do something.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The guard called the cleaner and asked her to open the door.""

We need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"".

The verb ""called"" introduces the subject ""the guard"", and the verb ""asked"" is the main action of the sentence.

The sentence has two nouns: ""the guard"" and ""the cleaner"". The verb ""called"" links the guard to the action of calling, but the verb ""asked"" is linked to the subject that is performing the action of asking.

Further, the verb ""asked"" uses the pronoun ""her"", which is likely referring to the subject that is performing the action of asking. In this case, the subject is either ""the guard"" or ""the cleaner"".

Therefore, the correct interpretation would be the one that makes sense grammatically and contextually.

The cleaner was called, and the cleaner is also the one being asked to open the door. This makes more sense than the guard, as it's unlikely for the guard to be asking himself/herself to open the door.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The guard called the cleaner and asked her to open the door.""

The pronoun is ""her"". To find the antecedent, we need to look for the subject that the pronoun is referring to.

The sentence starts with ""The guard called the cleaner..."" and then mentions ""her"". Now, ""her"" is likely referring to either the ""guard"" or the ""cleaner"", since they are the only two subjects mentioned prior to the pronoun.

So, the antecedent of ""her"" could be either the ""guard"" or the ""cleaner"". Therefore, the answer is:

The sentence says ""he used big words"", and the question is which option is the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the closest noun that has a masculine gender, which is ""developer"" or ""writer"". Since the sentence is talking about the inability to communicate, it's more reasonable to assume that the one who used big words is the one who couldn't communicate with the other.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the ""developer"".

Final Answer ((A)).
Let's break it down:

* The sentence is: ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because he used big words.""
* The pronoun is ""he"".
* Which thing does ""he"" refer to?
* The sentence implies that ""he"" is the one who used big words, as it mentions ""he used big words"" as the reason for the communication breakdown.
* This suggests that ""he"" refers to the one who used big words, which is either the developer or the writer.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the writer, as it is more likely that the writer uses big words that would make communication difficult.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down:

* The sentence starts with ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because...""
* The clause ""because he used big words"" explains why the developer was unable to communicate.
* The pronoun ""he"" refers to the person who used the big words. Who is that person? The sentence never explicitly says, but it's implied to be the same person who was unable to communicate with the writer.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the developer. The developer is the one who used the big words, and that's why they were unable to communicate with the writer.

* ""The developer argued with the designer"" sets up a contrast between the two individuals.
* ""because"" indicates a reason for the argument.
* ""they"" is the pronoun in question.

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to the entity that ""liked the design"", which is likely the same entity that the developer ""argued with"".

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is likely the designer, not the developer.

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The developer argued with the designer because they liked the design.""

The pronoun is ""they"". To determine what it refers to, we need to look for the subject that is performing the action ""liked the design"".

The closest subject before ""because"" is indeed ""they"", so the most likely antecedent is ""the developer and the designer"" (both of whom are arguing).

However, the sentence structure and word order suggest that ""they"" is more closely associated with the subject ""the developer"", as ""the developer argued"" is a more natural phrase than ""the designer argued"". It's more common to argue with someone because of a reason related to oneself, rather than the other person.

Given this, I would argue that the antecedent of ""they"" is more likely to be ""the developer"". This is because the sentence implies that the developer is arguing because the design is liked by themselves or their own perspective (the fact that the designer liked the design is supporting evidence, but it's not the main reason for the argument), rather than the designer being the one who liked the design.

So, I conclude that:

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence states: ""The developer argued with the designer because they liked the design.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to the person/ entity that performed the action ""liked the design"".

In this sentence, ""they"" is the object of the preposition ""because"", and it is referring to the last action performed before the argument started. The action is ""liked the design"".

Now, let's look at the options:

(A) The developer liked the design: Not the correct antecedent, as the developer is arguing with the designer, not themselves.

(B) The designer liked the design: This is the correct antecedent, as it is more likely that the designer would like their own design, rather than the developer liking the design.

(C) Ambiguous: Not in this case, as the sentence clearly indicates that the designer is the one who liked the design.

The sentence is: ""The pathologist obtained tissue samples from the victim to look at under their microscope.""

The pronoun is ""their"". It refers to the noun that comes closest to it, which is the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject is ""the pathologist"".

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is the pathologist, not the victim. The pathologist is the one who has the microscope.

Final Answer ((A))
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""The pathologist obtained tissue samples from the victim...""
	+ ""The pathologist"" is the subject of the sentence.
	+ ""the victim"" is the object of the preposition ""from"".
* ""...to look at under their microscope.""
	+ ""their"" is the possessive pronoun, referring to the microscope that something belongs to.

To determine what ""their"" refers to, we need to look back at the subject of the sentence, which is the pathologist. The pathologist is not mentioned as having a microscope, but the victim is not likely to have a microscope either (it's not common for victims to have microscopes).

Therefore, the most likely antecedent for ""their"" is the pathologist, as they are the ones performing the examination. It is likely that the pathologist uses their own microscope, rather than the victim's.

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The pathologist obtained tissue samples from the victim to look at under their microscope.""

The pronoun is ""their"".

To find the antecedent of ""their"", we need to identify the thing that ""their"" refers to.

Here are the options:

(A) It was the pathologist's microscope
(B) It was the victim's microscope
(C) Ambiguous

The sentence tells us that the pathologist obtained tissue samples from the victim, but it doesn't specify ""whose"" microscope. The possessive pronoun ""their"" can refer to either the pathologist (who is performing the action) or the victim (from whom the tissue samples were obtained).

The sentence is: ""The carpenter told the onlooker that she had been working on the house for three weeks.""

The pronoun is ""she"".

The question is: What had she been working on?

We need to find the antecedent, which is the noun that the pronoun refers to.

The nouns in the sentence are:

* The carpenter
* The onlooker
* The house

The verb ""working on"" is describing the house, not the carpenter or the onlooker.

So, the most logical antecedent for the pronoun ""she"" would be the carpenter. It makes sense that the carpenter would be the one working on the house.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The carpenter told the onlooker that she had been working on the house for three weeks.""

The pronoun ""she"" is being used to refer to someone who has been working on the house. We need to figure out who that person is.

The sentence states that ""the carpenter told the onlooker"" that she had been working on the house. It implies that the speaker is the carpenter, but it doesn't explicitly state that she is the one who has been working on the house.

So, the question is: Who has been working on the house?

There are two options:

A) The carpenter had been working on the house.
B) The onlooker had been working on the house.

Neither option can be definitively proved or disproved from the information given. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = (C)
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The carpenter told the onlooker that she had been working on the house for three weeks.""

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to:

* The person performing the action mentioned in the clause ""had been working on the house"".
* The phrase ""that she had been working on the house for three weeks"" is a dependent clause describing what the carpenter told the onlooker.
* So, the pronoun ""she"" is replacing the noun referring to the carpenter.

Therefore, the correct antecedent is:

2. ""but they didn't reply yet"": This sentence uses the pronoun ""they"". To determine what ""they"" refers to, we need to look back at the nouns introduced in the previous clause.

The only two nouns mentioned in the previous clause are ""the manager"" and ""the secretary"". Since ""the manager"" did the action of sending the message, it's unlikely that the pronoun would refer to the manager.

Therefore, the most plausible antecedent for the pronoun ""they"" is ""the secretary"", as the sentence is describing the secretary's lack of response.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The manager sent a message to the secretary, but they didn't reply yet.""

The pronoun ""they"" is the one we need to find the antecedent for.

The potential antecedents are ""the manager"" and ""the secretary"". The sentence describes the actions of both the manager and the secretary, but ""they"" is a plural pronoun, while only ""the secretary"" is plural (a single person).

Therefore, the most logical choice is that ""they"" refers to ""the secretary"", as ""the manager"" is a singular noun and would typically be replaced with a singular pronoun like ""he"" or ""she"".

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The manager sent a message to the secretary, but they didn't reply yet.""

The pronoun is ""they"". We need to find what it refers to.

We see that it's not referring back to ""manager"" because the subject is ""manager"" and the object is ""they"", which doesn't make sense.

The sentence is: ""The mechanic greets the receptionist because they were in a good mood.""

The pronoun ""they"" appears in the clause ""because they were in a good mood"", which is a dependent clause introduced by the subordinating conjunction ""because"".

To find the antecedent of ""they"", we need to look back in the sentence for the noun that it refers to. The possible antecedents are ""mechanic"" and ""receptionist"", since they are the only two nouns in the sentence.

The sentence doesn't mention anything about the mechanic's mood, so it's unlikely that ""they"" refers to the mechanic.

On the other hand, the sentence states that the receptionist is being greeted, which implies that the receptionist is the one being addressed, and thus, potentially in a good mood.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is likely the receptionist, who is the one being greeted.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The mechanic greets the receptionist because they were in a good mood.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to something or someone who was in a good mood. To figure out what it's referring to, we need to look for the closest noun that's in the proper grammatical case (i.e., singular or plural, and matching the mood of the sentence).

The closest nouns are ""the mechanic"" and ""the receptionist"". Let's consider each option:

(A) The mechanic was in a good mood: The mechanic is a singular entity, and ""they"" is a singular pronoun, so this is a plausible option. However, it wouldn't make sense for the mechanic to greet the receptionist because they were in a good mood – the mechanic is the one doing the greeting, not the one being greeted.

(B) The receptionist was in a good mood: The receptionist is a singular entity, and ""they"" is a singular pronoun, so this is another plausible option. And it would make sense that the receptionist's good mood might influence the mechanic's greeting.

(C) Ambiguous: We could argue that the sentence is ambiguous because it's possible to read it in different ways. For example, we could imagine a scenario where the mechanic is greeting the receptionist because the mechanic's assistant was in a good mood and is sitting nearby, but that would require some effortful parsing.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The mechanic greets the receptionist because they were in a good mood.""

The pronoun ""they"" is referring to the antecedent, i.e., the entity that the sentence is describing.

The sentence states that the mechanic greets the receptionist. The mechanic is performing the action of greeting.

The phrase ""because they were in a good mood"" indicates a reason why the mechanic is greeting the receptionist. This suggests that the mechanic's good mood is the reason for the greeting.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) The mechanic was in a good mood

This option seems plausible, as the sentence does mention the mechanic's good mood. However, it's not the most logical choice, as the sentence doesn't directly state that the mechanic is the one who was in a good mood. The phrase ""they were in a good mood"" doesn't clearly refer to the mechanic.

(B) The receptionist was in a good mood

This option is also possible, as the sentence doesn't explicitly state that the receptionist's good mood is the reason for the greeting. The phrase ""they were in a good mood"" could refer to the receptionist, making the mechanic's greeting a response to the receptionist's good mood.

(C) Ambiguous

Considering the options, it's difficult to pinpoint a clear antecedent for the pronoun ""they"". Both the mechanic and the receptionist could be in a good mood, and the sentence doesn't provide explicit clarification. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The options are:

(A) The janitor would have to mop
(B) The child would have to mop
(C) Ambiguous

The antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the person who warned the child, which is the janitor. If the child steps on the floor, the janitor would have to mop it again.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break down the sentence.

* ""they"" is the pronoun.
* ""they would have to mop"" is the clause it refers to.

The question is, what is ""they"" referring to - the janitor or the child?

* If it refers to the janitor, the meaning would be that the janitor would have to mop the floor.
* If it refers to the child, the meaning would be that the child would have to mop the floor.

Neither of these options seems entirely correct, as the janitor is warning the child not to step on the wet floor, implying that the janitor would be the one doing the mopping.

Therefore, the pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous, and it's not clear what it's referring to.

Final Answer = (C).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise they would have to mop it all over again.""

The pronoun is ""they"", and the question is: what does ""they"" refer to?

The subject of the sentence is ""the janitor"", and the action is ""warned"", which is directed towards ""the child"". The sentence is warning the child not to step on the wet floor, and if they do, there will be a consequence.

The consequence is ""they would have to mop it all over again"", which implies that someone (or something) will have to mop the floor. The question is: who or what is implied?

Given the context, it seems more plausible that the one who would have to mop is the janitor, not the child. The janitor is the one who is responsible for mopping the floor, and if someone steps on it, the janitor would be the one who has to mop it again. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is likely ""the janitor"", making option (A) the correct answer.

The pronoun is ""she"", and we need to find its antecedent, which is the thing it refers to.

The candidate options are:

1. A) The secretary
2. B) The developer
3. C) Ambiguous

Let's examine the sentence structure. ""The secretary corrected the developer because"" implies that something is going on with the developer (the problem is with the developer). The verb ""understood"" follows, which means that the person who understands the problem is the one performing the correction. This suggests that it is the secretary who understood the problem.

So, the antecedent of ""she"" is most likely ""The secretary"".

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The secretary corrected the developer because she better understood the problem.""

The pronoun ""she"" refers to the subject-verb agreement and the antecedent in the sentence. In this case, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the noun ""secretary"". The sentence implies that the secretary, not the developer, understood the problem better.
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The secretary corrected the developer because she better understood the problem.""

The pronoun is ""she"", and we need to find out what it refers to.

The antecedent is the noun that the pronoun ""she"" refers to. In this case, the options are:

* The secretary
* The developer

The sentence structure suggests that the pronoun ""she"" is the subject performing the action of ""better understood"". This implies that the antecedent is the one who undertakes the action.

Therefore, the antecedent is the one who has a better understanding of the problem.

""The paralegal forgot to file paperwork for the client so he was fired.""

We need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

* ""The paralegal"" is a noun phrase that refers to a person.
* ""The client"" is a noun phrase that refers to someone else.
* The sentence implies that the paralegal's action (forgetting to file paperwork) has a consequence, and that consequence is getting fired.

Given the context, it's clear that the pronoun ""he"" refers to the paralegal, not the client. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is:

The paralegal

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The paralegal forgot to file paperwork for the client so he was fired.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

We know that the paralegal is the one who did the forgetting, but we don't know who ""he"" refers to.

""He"" could refer to the paralegal, indicating that the paralegal was fired due to forgetting to file paperwork. This would make sense because the sentence starts by talking about the paralegal's mistake.

Or, ""he"" could refer to the client, indicating that the client was fired because the paperwork wasn't filed. This would be less likely, but not impossible.

Since the sentence doesn't clearly indicate who ""he"" refers to, I would say that the antecedent is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The paralegal forgot to file paperwork for the client so he was fired.""

The pronoun is ""he"". To find the antecedent of ""he"", we need to look for the noun that it refers to.

The sentence mentions ""the paralegal"" and ""the client"" as two separate nouns. Both of these nouns are singular and male, but ""he"" is a pronoun that can refer to either a male or a female.

The crucial part of the sentence is the phrase ""for the client"". This indicates that the action of forgetting to file paperwork is related to the client, rather than the paralegal.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""he"" is likely ""the client"", because the sentence implies that the client is the one being fired due to the paralegal's mistake.

""The hygienist told the patient that they should floss every day.""

The pronoun is ""they"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify the noun or pronoun that ""they"" refers back to.

The sentence structure is:
""The hygienist told the patient that..."".

The ""that"" clause is providing information to the patient. The subject of the ""that"" clause is ""they"".

The sentence is specifically telling the patient that they (the patient) should floss every day, not the hygienist.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the ""patient"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The pronoun ""they"" refers to the subject of the sentence. The subject is ""the hygienist"" or ""the patient"".

The sentence says ""the hygienist told the patient"", so the verb ""told"" is performed by the hygienist, and the patient is the recipient of the action. This means that the hygienist is the one doing the telling, and the patient is the one being told.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is likely to be the patient, as the patient is the one who is being told something (that they should floss every day).

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

* The sentence says ""The hygienist told the patient...""
* The sentence is saying that the hygienist gave some advice or instruction to the patient.
* The word ""they"" is being used as the subject of the following verb ""should floss"".
* Since the hygienist is not the one who should floss, but rather the patient, the antecedent of ""they"" must be the patient.
* Therefore, ""they"" refers to the patient.

* ""The driver yelled at the tailor"" - we know that the driver is yelling at the tailor, but we don't know what the driver is yelling about yet.
* ""after she broke a window"" - this clause tells us when the driver yelled at the tailor. It implies that the tailor did something (broke a window) before the driver started yelling.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the tailor. The tailor is the one who broke the window according to the sentence.

Final Answer = (B)
To determine the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"", we need to consider the sentence structure and the meaning. In this sentence, ""she"" refers to the subject who performed the action of breaking a window.

The sentence mentions ""the driver"" and ""the tailor"", both of whom could potentially break a window. However, ""she"" cannot refer to ""the driver"" because the driver is a male noun, and ""she"" is a pronoun that typically refers to a female.

Therefore, the only remaining option is ""the tailor"". Since ""the tailor"" is the only potential subject who matches the gender of the pronoun ""she"", the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The driver yelled at the tailor after she broke a window.""

The pronoun is ""she"".

To find the antecedent, we need to look back to the sentence and find the noun that ""she"" refers to.

The options are: A) The driver, B) The tailor

Since the sentence uses the phrase ""after she broke a window"", it implies that the tailor broke the window, not the driver.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the tailor.

The pronoun ""she"" is present in the sentence, and we need to identify what it refers to.

The surrounding words provide context: ""Alex tells us that..."". It's clear that Alex is the one telling us something. The phrase ""that she could not meet"" is the content of what Alex is telling us.

In this structure, ""she"" is likely referring back to Alex, as Alex is the one performing the action of telling and providing the information.

So, the antecedent of ""she"" is likely Alex.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""Alex tells us that she could not meet.""

Here, ""she"" is a pronoun referring to the subject of the sentence following ""that"", which is ""she could not meet"".

Since ""she"" is referring to the subject of the sentence, we can identify the antecedent of the pronoun as ""she could not meet"", which is a phrase stating that someone (possibly Alex) could not meet.

Therefore, the correct option is:

Final Answer ((A)).
Let's break it down:

* The sentence is ""Alex tells us that she could not meet.""
* The pronoun is ""she"".
* The word ""that"" introduces a subordinate clause, which is ""she could not meet"".
* The subordinate clause is describing what Alex is telling us, which is that some person (who is referred to as ""she"") could not meet.
* Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the person who could not meet.
* Since Alex is the subject of the main clause, it is possible to interpret ""she"" as referring to Alex, but it is also possible to interpret it as referring to someone else mentioned earlier in the context (if there is any).

The pronoun is ""her"".

The antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the person who receives the discount. And according to the sentence, that person is the clerk.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence together.

The sentence is: ""The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave her a discount.""

1. The subject of the sentence is ""the carpenter"", who performs the action of making a desk.
2. The phrase ""for the clerk"" indicates that the desk is for the clerk, but it doesn't directly relate to the action of giving a discount.
3. The sentence then says ""gave her a discount"". The pronoun ""her"" needs to refer to someone in the sentence. 

The most logical and grammatically correct option is to assume that ""her"" refers to the clerk, since the sentence already mentioned the desk was made for her. This means the carpenter gave a discount to the clerk.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the clerk.

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence step by step.

The sentence is: ""The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave her a discount.""

We need to find the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"". To do this, we need to identify the noun that is most closely associated with the pronoun ""her"".

The noun that is most closely associated with the pronoun ""her"" is the noun ""clerk"". The sentence states that the carpenter made a desk for the clerk, and then gave her a discount. This suggests that the discount is being given to the clerk, rather than the carpenter.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

* The object of the verb ""called"" is ""the editor"".
* The phrase ""and told them"" is a dependent clause, with ""told"" as the verb.
* The subject of the verb ""told"" is ""them"", which is the object of the verb ""called"" (i.e. ""the editor"").

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"" is the object of the verb ""called"", which is ""the editor"".

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The construction worker called the editor and told them the whole story.""

The pronoun is ""them"". To find the antecedent, we need to look at the nouns in the sentence and see which one makes sense as the referent.

The sentence mentions two nouns: ""construction worker"" and ""editor"". The ""construction worker"" is the one who did the calling, so it's unlikely that ""them"" refers to the ""construction worker"".

On the other hand, the ""editor"" is the one who received the call, so it's more plausible that ""them"" refers to the ""editor"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"".

* ""The construction worker called the editor"" implies that the editor is the one who receives the call.
* ""and told them the whole story"" - The question is, who is the ""them"" that the story is being told to?

The most logical and natural interpretation is that the ""them"" refers back to ""the editor"", as we just established that the editor is the one who received the call.

So, we have ""My cousin"" and ""his boss"" is the cousin's boss. The correct option is:

Final Answer ((A))
Let's analyze the sentence ""My cousin called his boss for more information"".

The pronoun ""his"" refers to the antecedent ""cousin"" because ""cousin"" is a male referent and the pronoun ""his"" is a masculine pronoun.

Since the sentence only mentions one cousin, we can conclude that ""his"" refers to the cousin's boss. (Option A)
Let's break down the sentence: ""My cousin called his boss for more information""

* ""My cousin"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""his"" is a possessive adjective modifying the noun ""boss"". The question is who does ""his"" refer to.
* The most natural interpretation is that ""his"" refers to ""my cousin"", because it's more likely for a person to call their own boss.
* So, the antecedent of ""his"" is ""my cousin"".

Therefore, there is no need to consider options (A) and (B), as they both involve a third entity that is not mentioned in the sentence.

Final Answer = (None). 

===== 

Wait, I see what you're getting at! The sentence is actually ambiguous. The pronoun ""his"" could also refer to the boss, if we interpret the sentence as ""My cousin called the boss of his"". In this case, ""his"" would refer to the boss, not the cousin.

The sentence is: ""The salesperson tried to fool the writer and sold him some garbage.""

The pronoun is ""him"".

The two nouns in the sentence are ""salesperson"" and ""writer"". We need to identify which one is the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"".

The sentence mentions that the salesperson tried to fool the writer, which implies that the salesperson is trying to deceive or trick the writer. This gives us a hint about who ""him"" might refer to.

Since the salesperson is trying to deceive the writer, it's likely that ""him"" refers to the writer, rather than the salesperson.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence step by step:

""The salesperson tried to fool the writer""

Here, we have two people mentioned: the salesperson and the writer.

""and sold him some garbage""

The pronoun ""him"" is intended to refer to one of these two people. To determine which one, let's look at the options:

(A) Sold the salesperson some garbage

The salesperson is the one trying to fool the writer, but ""him"" is not a good choice to refer to the salesperson because the sentence would imply that the salesperson is being sold something. This is unlikely.

(B) Sold the writer some garbage

Here, ""him"" could refer to the writer, making sense because the sentence implies that the writer was mislead and sold something they didn't need.

(C) Ambiguous

No, it's not ambiguous. The sentence is clear in its meaning, and ""him"" definitely refers to the writer.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The salesperson tried to fool the writer and sold him some garbage.""

The pronoun is ""him"", which refers to the object of the verb ""sold"". The verb ""sold"" has two possible objects: ""the salesperson"" and ""the writer"".

The sentence doesn't provide explicit information to determine which one is the object, so we have to look for clues.

The phrase ""tried to fool"" suggests that the writer is being deceived, which implies that the salesperson is the one doing the selling.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is indeed the writer.

Let's break down the sentence:

""The reporter and the chef discussed their favorite dishes.""

The phrase ""The reporter and the chef"" is a compound subject, consisting of two individuals. The pronoun ""their"" is singular, but it can refer to either the reporter, the chef, or both.

Since the sentence doesn't provide additional information, it's difficult to conclude which one of them the pronoun ""their"" specifically refers to. Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer = (C)
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The reporter and the chef discussed their favorite dishes.""

The pronoun ""their"" is referring to the topic being discussed, but to whom does it belong? This is where we need to look at the relationship between the entities mentioned in the sentence.

The sentence mentions a reporter and a chef as the two entities having a discussion. When we use the pronoun ""their"" to describe the favorite dishes, it's natural to assume that it belongs to the entities that are discussing the dishes, which are the reporter and the chef.

The sentence is: ""The CEO bought the accountant a car because he needed one.""

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"", we need to identify what person or thing it refers to in the sentence.

The phrase ""he needed one"" is saying that someone needs a car. Now, we have two possible referents: the CEO and the accountant.

The CEO bought the car for the accountant, which means the CEO is the one who bought the car, not the accountant. This implies that the accountant is the one who needed the car, not the CEO.

1. The sentence states that ""he"" needed a car.
2. The word ""he"" is a pronoun that refers to the antecedent in the sentence.
3. The closest noun to the pronoun ""he"" is ""accountant"", but it doesn't make sense for the accountant to need a car because they were given a car by the CEO.
4. The only other option is ""the CEO"", but it's also unlikely that the CEO needed a car because they bought it for the accountant.

The closest noun to ""she"" is ""the librarian"", but it doesn't refer to the same thing as ""she"". The librarian is the one helping, not the one asking.

The next closest noun is ""the CEO"", but it's also not the one asking. The CEO is the one getting help.

The pronoun ""she"" appears in the sentence. To find the antecedent, we need to look back in the sentence for the noun that ""she"" refers to.

The noun that precedes ""she"" is ""the librarian"" in the first clause. However, ""the librarian"" is a feminine noun, but ""she"" is the pronoun referring to the one who asked. The subject of the sentence is masculine (the CEO), so it doesn't match.

The most likely antecedent for ""she"" is the main clause's subject, which is ""the CEO"". It's possible that the CEO is the one who asked to find the book.

Final Answer = ((B)).

""The librarian helped the CEO to find the book because she asked.""

The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to the person who asked for something. 

The options are:
(A) The librarian asked
(B) The CEO asked

Since the sentence is in the past tense and ""because"" indicates the reason, we are looking for the person who performed the action ""asked"" in the past.

1. ""It"" could refer to Bailey's office, but this doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. Bailey is planning to meet the director, not their office.
2. ""It"" could refer to the director's office, which is a more likely and logical interpretation. The sentence is saying that Bailey plans to meet the director at the director's office.

(A) The librarian asked

(C) Ambiguous
End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break down the sentence:

""The librarian helped the CEO to find the book because he asked.""

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to someone who asked for something. We need to find the person who did the asking.

The possibilities are:

* The librarian asked (is it possible that the librarian asked to find the book? No, it doesn't make sense in this context.)
* The CEO asked (this possibility makes sense, as the CEO is the one who would typically ask for a book to be found)

Since the CEO is the more likely candidate to ask for a book to be found, the answer is:

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The librarian helped the CEO to find the book because he asked.""

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to the subject of the sentence, but which one is it?

The sentence starts with ""The librarian helped the CEO..."", so the librarian is the one doing the helping, and the CEO is the one being helped. Then it says ""because he asked"".

In this context, ""he"" is likely referring to the CEO, because CEOs are often the ones who ask for things to be done. It makes sense that the CEO would ask the librarian to help him find a book.

So, going back to the options:

* (A) The librarian asked: This is not the most likely option, as it doesn't fit the context of the sentence.
* (B) The CEO asked: This option fits the context of the sentence, so it's the most likely answer.
* (C) Ambiguous: This option is not correct, as it's clear that ""he"" is referring to the CEO.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

In the sentence ""The librarian helped the CEO to find the book because he asked."", the pronoun ""he"" is referred to as the antecedent.

Who asked is the question to be answered. 

The subject of the sentence is ""the librarian"" and the object is ""the CEO"". But ""he"" is not referring to either of these. 

The word ""asked"" is in the past tense, which implies that the sentence is talking about a request or a question that was asked by someone. 

Now, there are two options - the librarian or the CEO. But the sentence does not provide any initial information about who asked. 

Hence, the antecedent of ""he"" is ambiguous, as it could be the librarian or the CEO.

Sentence: The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave him a blueprint.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave him a blueprint.""

The pronoun is ""him"", and we need to find out what it refers to.

The phrase ""with the carpenter"" indicates that the designer and the carpenter are working together.

The phrase ""gave him"" is a verb phrase that is parallel to the phrase ""collaborated with"", suggesting that the designer is the one performing the action.

The noun ""blueprint"" is the direct object of the verb ""gave"", meaning it is the thing being given.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that ""him"" refers to the carpenter, as the pronoun is singular and agrees with the noun ""carpenter"" in number and gender.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave him a blueprint.""

The pronoun is ""him"", which refers to the object of the verb ""gave"".

The verb ""gave"" has two objects: the designer and the carpenter. However, the designer is the subject of the sentence, and the carpenter is the object of the prepositional phrase ""with the carpenter"".

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is the carpenter.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The designer collaborated with the carpenter and gave him a blueprint.""

The pronoun ""him"" refers to the person who performed the action of ""collaborating"". This is because ""him"" is the direct object of the verb ""gave"".

The sentence states that ""the designer"" collaborated, so ""the carpenter"" must be the direct object, i.e., the one who performed the action of collaborating.

Therefore, ""him"" refers to ""the carpenter"", not ""the designer"". So, the correct answer is:

""The developer corrected the secretary because they better understood the problem.""

The pronoun ""they"" is what we're trying to identify the antecedent for.

The sentence is correcting someone (the secretary) because of a reason (they better understood the problem). This implies that ""they"" refers to the one who corrected, which is the developer.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the developer.

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's analyze the sentence step by step!

The sentence is: ""The developer corrected the secretary because they better understood the problem.""

We can identify the two nouns: ""developer"" and ""secretary"".

The pronoun ""they"" seems to refer to one of these two entities.

To determine the antecedent, we need to look at the verb ""understood"". This verb modifies the subject of the clause ""because they better understood the problem"". The pronoun ""they"" is performing the action of understanding.

The verb ""understood"" is in the plural form, which suggests that the subject it is modifying is also plural.

Considering the plural nature of the verb, we can conclude that the pronoun ""they"" refers to a plural entity, which is not either of the singular nouns ""developer"" or ""secretary"".

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is not clearly stated in the sentence. It could be a plural entity not mentioned in the sentence, making it ambiguous.

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""The developer corrected the secretary""
	+ The developer and the secretary are the two entities involved in the action of correcting.
* ""because they better understood the problem""
	+ The pronoun ""they"" is referring to one of the two entities mentioned earlier.
* To determine which entity ""they"" is referring to, we need to look at the sentence structure and the relationship between the clauses.

The sentence has a cause-and-effect structure, where the developer corrected the secretary because of a reason. The reason is that ""they"" better understood the problem.

Based on the sentence structure, it's more likely that the pronoun ""they"" refers to ""the developer"" rather than ""the secretary"". This is because the developer is the one performing the action of correcting, and the reason for correcting is that they better understood the problem.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The pronoun is ""she"". We need to find out what ""she"" refers to in the sentence.

The subject of the sentence is ""the customer"", and the verb is ""asked"". The customer is asking the salesperson something.

The phrase ""if she could send..."" is a dependent clause, and it's asking for permission to do something. The subject of this clause is not explicitly stated, but since the customer is asking the salesperson, it's likely that the ""she"" refers to the salesperson, not the customer.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the salesperson.

Final Answer = ((B))

* (C) Ambiguous

We need to determine what ""her"" refers to. Both the customer and the chef are mentioned, but one of them is not a woman, so the pronoun ""her"" cannot refer to the customer. Therefore, it must refer to the chef, as it is a female noun.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The customer and the chef discussed her culinary training.""

The pronoun ""her"" refers to the person involved in the training, not the one discussing it. The subject of the sentence is ""the customer and the chef"", which means the action is being performed by both of them.

In this case, the pronoun ""her"" must refer to a person who has received culinary training, likely a woman.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The customer and the chef discussed her culinary training.""

The pronoun is ""her"".

To determine the antecedent of the pronoun, we need to find the noun that ""her"" refers to.

The options are:

1. It was the customer's culinary training (Option (A))
2. It was the chef's culinary training (Option (B))

The sentence does not explicitly state which one, so we need to use context and inference to determine the antecedent.

In this sentence, ""her"" could be referring to the customer or the chef. The customer is a person who ordered food, and it's possible that they discussed their own culinary training. On the other hand, the chef is a person with expertise in culinary training, and it's equally possible that they discussed their own training.

In the sentence ""The patient was referred to the specialist because she had a rare skin condition"", the pronoun is ""she"".

In the sentence ""The educator was meeting with a student to discuss her grading policy"", the pronoun ""her"" refers to the student, not the educator. This is because the subject of the sentence is the educator, and the student is the object they're meeting with. The pronoun ""her"" is in the possessive form, indicating that it belongs to the student.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The educator was meeting with a student to discuss her grading policy.""

The pronoun is ""her"", which refers to the subject of the sentence.

The subject is ""a student"", which is an indefinite noun.

The question asks what is being discussed in the meeting. The answer to this question is the ""grading policy"", which is a possessive noun.

So, the question is asking what is meant by ""her grading policy""? Does it belong to the educator or the student?

The answer is that the grading policy belongs to the educator, as the sentence states ""the educator was meeting with a student to discuss her grading policy"". This implies that the educator is the one being discussed, not the student.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break it down!

The sentence is: ""The educator was meeting with a student to discuss her grading policy.""

The pronoun is ""her"".

To find the antecedent, we need to look back and identify what the pronoun refers to. The pronoun ""her"" is used to refer to the subject of the sentence. Since the sentence has two subjects, ""The educator"" and ""a student"", it's possible that the pronoun ""her"" could refer to either one.

To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun that ""they"" refers to. The options are:

1. The patient
2. The specialist

Now, based on the sentence structure and meaning, ""they"" is likely to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is the one that is performing the action of being referred. In this case, it is the patient who is being referred, not the specialist.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""they"" is:

1. The patient

So, the correct answer is:

Let's analyze the sentence:

""The patient was referred to the specialist because they are an expert on rare skin conditions.""

The pronoun ""they"" is the focus of the sentence. To determine the antecedent, we need to look back at the noun phrases that could possibly refer to ""they"".

The nouns in the sentence are ""patient"" and ""specialist"". The sentence states that the patient was referred to the specialist, which implies that the specialist is the one who receives the referral.

The phrase ""because they are an expert on rare skin conditions"" indicates that the reason for the referral is because the specialist has expertise in rare skin conditions.

Since the sentence states that the referral is made because of the specialist's expertise, it's reasonable to conclude that ""they"" refers to the specialist.

* We have a sentence with a pronoun ""they"".
* The pronoun ""they"" refers to the entity that is being described as an expert.
* The subject of the sentence is ""the patient"", which is being referred to the specialist.
* The verb ""are"" agrees with the subject-verb agreement rules, and it implies that the specialist is the one who is an expert.

Let's analyze the sentence: ""Bailey will plan to meet the director at her office""

Here, the pronoun is ""her"". To find the antecedent of the pronoun, we need to identify what ""her"" is substituting for.

The only noun in the sentence with a gender is ""director"", but ""director"" is a masculine noun (it's singular and doesn't have a feminine form). Therefore, ""her"" cannot be referring to ""director"".

The only other noun in the sentence is ""Bailey"", but ""Bailey"" is a feminine noun (assuming it's the name of a person). Since ""her"" is a feminine pronoun, it's likely referring to ""Bailey"".

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is ""Bailey"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""Bailey will plan to meet the director at her office""

The pronoun is ""her"". To determine the antecedent, we need to identify the noun that ""her"" refers to.

The options present are:

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is most likely the ""salesperson"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told her a fake story.""

The pronoun ""her"" refers to the antecedent ""salesperson"", because the speaker is talking about the person who was being fooled. The writer is the one telling the fake story, but the sentence is saying that the writer told the story TO the salesperson, not TO the writer.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the salesperson.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told her a fake story.""

The pronoun ""her"" is referring to someone. We can't be sure who it is referring to immediately.

First, let's look for the antecedent within the same sentence. The closest noun to the pronoun ""her"" is ""salesperson"". However, it's unlikely that the salesperson would be the one being told a fake story (it's more likely to be the writer).

Looking further back, we can see that the subject of the sentence is ""the writer"". And the sentence structure suggests that the writer is the one doing the telling.

* ""that"" - This word introduces a clause that gives more information about what the engineer is saying to the client.
* ""he would need to make all future payments on time"" - This clause states what the engineer is saying to the client.

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the thing that is performing the action of making payments. In this case, it's likely referring to the client, as the sentence is saying that the client needs to make all future payments on time. It's not saying that the engineer needs to make payments.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the client.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down. The pronoun is ""he"", and it appears in the sentence ""he would need to make all future payments on time"".

To find the antecedent of ""he"", we need to look at the preceding words and see what noun or pronoun refers back to ""he"".

The preceding words are ""The engineer informed the client"", so we have two options: ""The engineer"" and ""The client"".

The sentence implies that ""the engineer"" is the one who needs to make the payments, as the verb phrase ""would need to make"" is in the first person singular, indicating the engineer's own action. Therefore, the antecedent of ""he"" is ""The engineer"".

Final Answer ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The engineer informed the client that he would need to make all future payments on time.""

The pronoun is ""he"". We need to find the antecedent, which is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun refers to.

The noun phrase in the sentence is ""the engineer"" and ""the client"". The verb ""informed"" indicates that one of these is the subject of the sentence, and the other is the object. The bracketed clause ""that he would need to make all future payments on time"" is a dependent clause, meaning it provides additional information about the main clause.

The pronoun ""he"" must refer to the subject of the main clause, which is the one doing the informing. Since the engineer is informing the client, the engineer is the subject, making ""he"" refer to the engineer.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is ""the engineer"".

The pronoun ""their"" refers to the possessor of the secretary. The sentence does not specify which parent is calling the secretary, so it could be either of them.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is the parent who is calling the secretary.

Let's break down the sentence: ""My parent called their secretary for more information.""

1. The pronoun is ""their"". It is modifying ""secretary"".
2. The antecedent of ""their"" should be the one that owns or has control over the secretary.

Now, let's look at the options:
(A) ""They were my parent's secretary"" - In this case, ""they"" refers to the person who is the secretary of my parent. So, ""their"" rightly refers to the parent, indicating that the parent's secretary is being referred to.

(B) ""They were the secretary's secretary"" - In this case, ""they"" refers to the secretary (of the secretary). But ""their"" refers to the parent, not the secretary. This doesn't make sense, as the parent wouldn't own the secretary's secretary.

(C) ""Ambiguous"" - No, it's not ambiguous. The antecedent is clearly the parent, as ""their"" refers to the one who has control over the secretary.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""My parent called their secretary for more information""

The pronoun ""their"" refers to the possessive form of a noun, indicating that the secretary belongs to the person or entity being referred to. The antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is the subject ""parent"", but the subject ""parent"" is singular, not plural.

Since the pronoun ""their"" is singular, it cannot refer to a plural noun (such as multiple secretaries). Therefore, we can conclude that:

""Their"" refers to the parent's secretary.

The sentence is: ""The cleaner called the guard and asked him to open the door.""

The pronoun is ""him"". This pronoun is referring to a person in the sentence.

The sentence mentions two individuals: ""the cleaner"" and ""the guard"".

The action of ""asking"" is related to the person who performed the action of ""calling"".

The cleaner called the guard, and then the guard was asked to do something.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is the ""guard"", because the guard was the one who was asked to open the door.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down:

""him"" is a pronoun that needs to be paired with its antecedent.

The sentence mentions ""the cleaner"" and ""the guard"", but which one was referred to as ""him""?

To find the antecedent, we need to look at the context and the sentence structure.

The sentence has: ""The cleaner called the guard and asked HIM to open the door.""

The verb ""called"" is followed by ""the guard"", which suggests that someone (the cleaner) called someone else (the guard).

Then, the sentence continues with ""asked HIM to open the door"". Since ""him"" is clearly referring to the one who was asked to do something, this must be the guard.

So, the correct answer is:

""The visitor tells the teacher that she likes the cake.""

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to...

* ""The visitor"" is not a likely candidate, as visitors are typically the ones who are not liking the cake.
* ""The teacher"" is also not a likely candidate, as teachers are typically the ones teaching, not liking cakes.

Therefore, the most likely antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is a third-person singular female, which is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. This makes the answer:

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break it down:

* The sentence is: ""The visitor tells the teacher that she likes the cake.""
* The pronoun is ""she"".
* To find the antecedent, we need to identify what the pronoun refers to.
* The options are: the visitor, the teacher, or it could be ambiguous.

The verb phrase ""she likes the cake"" is in the clause ""that she likes the cake"", which is the complement of the verb ""tells"".
The complement ""that she likes the cake"" is describing the thought or idea that the visitor is telling the teacher.
In this case, ""she"" is referring to the visitor, as the visitor is the one who likes the cake.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The visitor tells the teacher that she likes the cake.""

The word ""she"" is the pronoun we're trying to find an antecedent for.

The options are:
(A) The visitor likes the cake
(B) The teacher likes the cake
(C) Ambiguous

The words ""the visitor"" are the subject of the sentence, and they are not related to the pronoun ""she"". The word ""she"" could be referring to either the visitor or the teacher, as both are entities that could engage in the action described, which is liking the cake.

However, we can't determine with certainty which one is the antecedent without more context or information. Therefore, I would say that the sentence is indeed:

The given sentence is: ""The developer met with the designer because his idea can be implemented.""

The pronoun is ""his"". We need to find out what ""his"" refers to, which is the antecedent.

The most likely candidate for the antecedent is ""the developer"". The developer is the one who had the idea, and ""his"" is likely referring to the developer's idea.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step!

1. The sentence says ""The developer met with the designer because...""
2. The clause ""his idea can be implemented"" starts with ""his"", which is a pronoun.
3. The question is: What idea is being referred to?

Looking at the sentence, we see that there are two entities mentioned: ""the developer"" and ""the designer"". Neither of them has been explicitly linked to an ""idea"" yet.

Without additional context, it's unclear which idea is being referred to: the developer's idea or the designer's idea.

Therefore, I conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is ambiguous.

Final Answer = ((C)).
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The developer met with the designer because his idea can be implemented.""

The pronoun is ""his"", which implies a masculine possessive pronoun. The word ""his"" is referring to a noun that belongs to someone or something. We need to find the antecedent, which is the word that ""his"" is replacing.

The nouns in the sentence are ""developer"" and ""designer"". However, neither of them is explicitly mentioned as a possessor of an idea. The phrase ""his idea"" suggests that someone's idea can be implemented, but we need to identify whose idea that is.

The closest antecedent is the phrase ""because [something] can be implemented"". This phrase is explaining why the developer met with the designer. Therefore, the antecedent of ""his"" is likely to be the developer, as his idea (the developer's idea) can be implemented.

The sentence is: ""The CEO bought the accountant a car because they needed one.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

* ""they"" is referring to the person or thing who needed a car.
* The sentence structure implies that ""they"" is not referring to the CEO, because the CEO is the one doing the buying. So, ""they"" cannot be the CEO.
* Therefore, ""they"" must be referring to the accountant, since the accountant is the person who is being given the car.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The CEO bought the accountant a car because they needed one.""

The pronoun ""they"" refers to the reason why the CEO bought the car. The reason is expressed in the phrase ""they needed one"".

We are looking for the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"", which is the thing that the pronoun refers to.

The options are:
(A) The CEO needed a car
(B) The accountant needed a car
(C) Ambiguous

As the reason for buying the car is an action performed by the accountant, the antecedent of ""they"" is the accountant. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer ((B)).
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""The CEO bought the accountant a car"" - This clause is describing the action of buying a car. The CEO is the agent performing the action, and the accountant is the recipient of the action.
* ""because they needed one"" - This clause is providing the reason for the action. The pronoun ""they"" is referring to the person or entity that needed a car.

Since the CEO is the one performing the action of buying, it's likely that ""they"" refers to the accountant, as the sentence is describing the CEO's action of buying a car for the accountant. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The pronoun ""them"" is referring to someone who helped.

* The subject of the sentence is ""the secretary"", who came to the office.
* The action of helping was performed by the secretary, but it's not clear who the beneficiary of that help is.

There are only two plausible candidates for ""them"":

(A) ""The secretary helped the secretary to book a flight"" (which doesn't make sense)
(B) ""The secretary helped the analyst to book a flight"" (a logical possibility)

Since the sentence doesn't provide sufficient context to disambiguate, we have to conclude that:

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The secretary came to the analyst's office and helped them to book a flight.""

The pronoun ""them"" is referring to the same person or thing as the antecedent. In this sentence, the antecedent could be:

1. The secretary (option A): This is unlikely, as it would mean the secretary helped the secretary book a flight, which doesn't make sense.
2. The analyst (option B): This is a possible antecedent, as it would mean the analyst (who shares the office with the secretary) is the one being helped to book a flight.

The phrase ""the analyst's office"" suggests that the analyst is related to the office, which supports the idea that the pronoun ""them"" is referring to the analyst.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

* ""The secretary came to the analyst's office..."" - This sets up two individuals: the secretary and the analyst.
* ""...and helped them..."" - This is where the pronoun ""them"" is introduced.

The pronoun ""them"" requires an antecedent, which is the thing it refers to. In this case, the antecedent is most likely the analyst, as the secretary is already explicitly mentioned as the subject performing the action. The phrase ""the analyst's office"" suggests that the analyst is the one who owns/occupies the office, making it more likely that ""them"" refers to the analyst.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"" is the analyst.

The sentence is: ""The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave her a prototype.""

The pronoun is ""her"".

To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun that the pronoun is replacing.

The sentence mentions two nouns: ""carpenter"" and ""designer"". One of these nouns must be replaced by the pronoun ""her"".

The verb ""collaborated"" and ""gave"" indicate that the carpenter and designer are working together. The sentence doesn't specify which one is doing the giving, but based on the relationship between the two, it's likely that it's the one who gave the prototype to the other person.

The pronoun ""her"" is likely referring to the designer, since the carpenter ""gave"" something to her, and it's more likely that the designer would receive the prototype than the carpenter.

Therefore, the answer is:

Final Answer ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave her a prototype.""

The pronoun is ""her"".

To determine the antecedent of ""her"", we need to find the closest noun that refers to a female entity.

The only nouns in the sentence are ""carpenter"" and ""designer"", and only ""designer"" is a female entity. Therefore, the antecedent of ""her"" is the ""designer"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave her a prototype.""

The pronoun ""her"" is referring to the object of the verb ""gave"". The object of the verb ""gave"" is either the carpenter or the designer. Since the designer is the one with whom the carpenter collaborated, it's more likely that ""her"" refers to the designer.

The pronoun is ""he"". 

The possibilities are:
- ""he"" refers to the surgeon (it's who the surgeon is referring to)
- ""he"" refers to the nurse (the nurse is who needs more time)

Since the surgeon is the one doing the warning and talking about needing more time, it makes sense to interpret ""he"" as referring to the surgeon.

So, the antecedent of ""he"" is the surgeon.

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The surgeon warned the nurse that he needed more time to prepare.""

The pronoun is ""he"". To determine the antecedent of ""he"", we need to find the noun or pronoun that the pronoun replaces or refers to.

The options are:

* (A) The surgeon
* (B) The nurse
* (C) Ambiguous

Now, let's analyze the sentence:

* ""The surgeon"" is the subject of the sentence, and it's unlikely that the surgeon is the one who needs more time to prepare.
* ""The nurse"" is the object of the sentence (receiving the warning), and it's possible that the nurse needs more time to prepare, but it's not the most natural interpretation.

Considering the sentence structure and the context, the most natural interpretation is that the surgeon is the one who needs more time to prepare. Therefore, the antecedent of ""he"" is:

Final Answer = ((A))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The surgeon warned the nurse that he needed more time to prepare.""

The pronoun is ""he"". We need to find out what ""he"" refers to.

The options are: The surgeon, The nurse, or it's ambiguous.

The context of the sentence is that the surgeon is warning the nurse, so it's likely that ""he"" refers to the one being warned, which is the one who needs more time.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the surgeon.

The sentence is: ""The manager asked the employee to not forget his car.""

The pronoun is ""his"". We need to find out which noun it refers to, either ""manager"" or ""employee"".

The phrase ""his car"" is typically possessive, indicating that ""his"" refers to the owner of the car. However, in this sentence, ""his"" only agrees with ""car"" in number (singular), but not in gender (no apostrophe is needed because ""manager"" can be a female or a non-binary person, but ""car"" is gender-neutral).

Now, let's look at the options:

(A) It was the manager's car: This option is possible, but it's an uncommon way of referring to something. People usually say ""don't forget the manager's car"" to clarify.

(B) It was the employee's car: This option is a bit more natural. It's a common idiomatic expression in English to say ""don't forget your car"" or ""don't forget his car"" when asking someone not to leave without bringing their own car.

(C) Ambiguous: Some might argue that the sentence is ambiguous because it doesn't explicitly state whose car is being referred to. However, based on common idiomatic expressions and the way the sentence is structured, option (B) seems more likely.

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The manager asked the employee to not forget his car.""

In this sentence, the pronoun is ""his"".

The potential antecedent for ""his"" is either ""manager"" or ""employee"".

However, ""manager"" cannot be the antecedent, because managers do not typically possess cars, and it's unlikely that a manager would be asking an employee to remember their car.

On the other hand, ""employee"" is more likely to possess a car, as it's a common possession for many people.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is likely to be ""employee"".

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break down the sentence:

""The manager asked the employee to not forget his car.""

The pronoun is ""his"". To determine the antecedent of ""his"", we need to look for the noun phrase that it is replacing.

The closest noun phrase to ""his"" is ""the employee"". However, ""the employee"" is a noun phrase referring to a person, not an object, so it cannot be the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"".

The next closest noun phrase is ""the manager"", but it is also a noun phrase referring to a person, not an object, so it cannot be the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"".

The only noun phrase left that could be the antecedent of ""his"" is the word ""car"", which is the object being referred to. Since ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, it implies that the car belongs to the thing that ""his"" is referring to.

Therefore, it is more likely that the antecedent of ""his"" is ""the car"", making option (A) the best choice:

Option (A): ""They were my cousin's boss"" - This sentence implies that ""they"" are the boss of my cousin. However, the original sentence doesn't specify this.

Option (B): ""They were the boss's boss"" - This sentence implies that ""they"" are a boss who has a boss. This is also possible in the context of the original sentence, but it's not specified.

Since the original sentence doesn't provide enough information to determine the antecedent of the pronoun, I would say:

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""My cousin called their boss for more information""

The pronoun ""their"" is referring to the ""boss"" that was called. The question is, who is this ""boss"" that was called?

Option (A) suggests that ""they"" are the cousin's boss, implying that the cousin is an employee and is calling their superior for more information.

Option (B) suggests that ""they"" are the boss of the boss, implying that the cousin is calling someone who is higher up in the management hierarchy.

Option (C) suggests that the relation between ""their"" and ""boss"" is ambiguous, meaning that it's unclear who ""they"" are in relation to the boss.

After re-evaluating the sentence, I believe that Option (A) is the most likely antecedent for the pronoun ""their"". The phrase ""for more information"" implies that the person being called is someone who has knowledge or authority related to the information, and it's more plausible that the cousin is an employee calling their direct supervisor or boss for clarification, rather than calling someone's superior.

Final Answer = ((A)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""My cousin called their boss for more information""

* ""My cousin"" is a noun phrase that refers to a specific person.
* ""their"" is a possessive pronoun that needs an antecedent to refer to.
* ""boss"" is the object of the preposition ""for"" and is described as ""their"".

The question is: what does ""their"" refer to?

* It could refer to the cousin's boss, meaning that the cousin is calling their own boss.
* It could refer to the boss's boss, meaning that the cousin is calling someone who is even higher in the hierarchy.

Since it's not clear from the sentence alone which one is intended, I would say that it's ambiguous.

""The chief"" is not a writer, so it can't be the one who wrote a good book.

On the other hand, ""the writer"" is the one who wrote a good book, according to the sentence.

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The chief encouraged the writer because he wrote a good book.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

The options are (A), (B), and (C).

Let's examine the sentence:

* ""The chief encouraged the writer"" suggests that the chief is the entity performing the action (encouraging).
* ""because"" is a subordinating conjunction introducing the reason for the encouragement.
* ""he wrote a good book"" is the clause explaining the reason (why the chief encouraged the writer).

Now, for the pronoun ""he"":

* It's clear that ""he"" is referring to the entity that performed the action described in the dependent clause (""because he wrote a good book"").
* The entity that wrote a good book must be the one that the chief encouraged.
* This phrase ""wrote a good book"" does not fit the description of ""The chief"" (since the chief did not write the book).
* Therefore, it's more likely that ""he"" is referring to ""the writer"" (the one being encouraged).

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is (B) ""The writer wrote a good book"".

Final Answer = ((B)).
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is ""The chief encouraged the writer because he wrote a good book.""

The pronoun is ""he"". To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun that ""he"" refers to.

In this sentence, we have two nouns: ""The chief"" and ""the writer"".

The sentence is: ""The driver yelled at the tailor after they broke a window.""

The pronoun is ""they"", and it needs an antecedent to refer to. The options are:

A. The driver
B. The tailor
C. Ambiguous

To determine the antecedent, we need to look at the sentence structure and the relationship between the subjects and the action described.

The sentence starts with ""The driver yelled at the tailor"", which suggests a verbal interaction between the driver and the tailor. The subject of the sentence is ""The driver"", and ""The tailor"" is the object of the verb ""yelled at"".

The phrase ""after they broke a window"" is added, indicating that the yelling occurred subsequent to the event described by ""they"". However, there are only two subjects mentioned in the sentence: ""The driver"" and ""The tailor"". ""They"" hasn't been introduced yet, so it cannot refer to ""The driver"" since it hasn't been mentioned as the doer of an action. 

On the other hand, ""the tailor"" already has a relationship established with ""The driver"" as the object of the verb ""yelled at"". Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that ""they"" refers to ""the tailor"", as if the tailor broke the window and the driver yelled at them because of it.

So, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = ((B))
Let's break it down step by step.

The sentence is: ""The driver yelled at the tailor after they broke a window.""

* ""they"" is the pronoun
* Looking for the word or phrase that it refers to, we find the verb ""broke a window""

* ""they"" could potentially refer to either ""the driver"" or ""the tailor"", because it's not explicitly stated which one performed the action.

Since it's not clear which one is the correct antecedent, the answer is:

Final Answer ((C)).
Let's break down the sentence:

""The driver yelled at the tailor after they broke a window.""

We need to identify who broke the window. The subject of the sentence is ""they"", but this pronoun is not agreeing with either ""driver"" or ""tailor"". However, it is clear that the driver and the tailor are the only two entities involved in the sentence, and one of them must be the one who broke the window.

Here's the key moment: the sentence does not wrap the phrase ""they broke a window"" in a subordinate clause or a description. It is simply ""they broke a window"". This means that the sentence is implying that both the driver and the tailor are possible candidates to have broken the window.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""they"" is ambiguous. It could be either the driver or the tailor.

* The clause ""he better understood the problem"" is likely describing someone who understood the problem.

Final Answer = ((C))
Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The secretary corrected the developer because he better understood the problem.""

The pronoun ""he"" is likely referring to the subject of the subordinate clause ""because he better understood the problem"". This subordinate clause is describing the reason why the secretary corrected the developer.

The subject of this subordinate clause is the one who ""better understood the problem"", which could be either ""the secretary"" or ""the developer"".

Final Answer = (C)
Let's analyze the sentence:

""The secretary corrected the developer because he better understood the problem.""

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the antecedent that is closer to it in the sentence. In this case, the options are ""the secretary"" and ""the developer"".

Both ""the secretary"" and ""the developer"" are nouns that can potentially be the subject of the verb ""understood"", but only one of them can be the correct antecedent of ""he"".

It seems more likely that ""the developer"" is the one who ""better understood the problem"", as the sentence is indicating that the secretary is correcting the developer because of this understanding.
