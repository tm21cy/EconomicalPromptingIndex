1. The sentence is: ""The patient was referred to the specialist because he had a rare skin condition.""

2. The pronoun ""he"" appears. We need to find out what antecedent the pronoun refers to.

3. The most likely candidate for the antecedent of ""he"" is ""the patient"". This is because the sentence structure suggests that the reason for referral is related to something about the patient.

4. Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent of ""he"" is ""the patient"".

5. This means that option (A) ""The patient had a skin condition"" is the correct answer. The rare skin condition mentioned in the sentence is something that the patient has, not the specialist.

1. The sentence is: ""The scientist collaborated with the artist, and he shared a story.""

First, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"". The pronoun ""he"" is referring to the subject of the sentence.

2. The subject of the sentence is ""the scientist"" who collaborated with ""the artist"".

3. Now, we can analyze the sentence further. Since the scientist collaborated with the artist, it's likely that ""he"" is referring to either the scientist or the artist.

4. We can eliminate the possibility of ""he"" referring to ""the artist"" because the sentence doesn't provide any information that would confirm this. However, we can infer that the scientist and the artist were working together, so the scientist is a more likely candidate to be referred to as ""he"".

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break down the context step by step.

Step 1: Identify the subject-verb agreement in the sentence.
The sentence is: ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer because she used big words.""

Step 2: Identify the verb that the subject ""she"" agrees with.
The verb is ""used"".

Step 3: Identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"".
The antecedent is the person who used big words. The sentence implies that the writer used big words, but it doesn't specifically state that.

Step 4: Analyze the options.

Option (A) states that the developer uses big words. However, the sentence doesn't provide evidence to support this claim. The sentence only mentions the writer using big words.

Option (B) states that the writer uses big words. This option is consistent with the sentence, as it implies that the writer's use of big words was the reason the developer was unable to communicate with her.

Option (C) states that it's ambiguous. While it's true that the sentence doesn't explicitly state that the writer is the one who used big words, the sentence does provide context that suggests the writer is the one who used big words, and this option doesn't accurately capture the subtlety of the sentence. A more accurate summary would be to say that the sentence subtly implies that the writer uses big words.

Considering the context, we can deduce that the pronoun ""he"" likely refers to the scientist, as it is more likely for the scientist to share a story about their collaboration with the artist rather than the artist sharing a story about the collaboration.

Therefore, I conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the scientist.

The sentence is: ""Bailey planned to meet the director at their office""

The pronoun is ""their"". To determine the antecedent, we need to find the noun that the pronoun refers to.

The nouns in the sentence are:
- Bailey
- director
- office

The verb ""their"" is not describing Bailey, because it's not saying ""Bailey's office"". Nor is it describing the director, because the director is a separate person from the one who owns the office.

The only option left is to consider that the ""their"" is describing the director. This implies that the director has an office, which is supported by options (A) and (B).

The pronoun is ""she"".

**Step 2: Determine the antecedent of the pronoun**
The antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the person who is doing the liking.

**Step 3: Analyze the sentence**
The sentence says ""The developer argued with the designer because she liked the design."" This implies that the developer and the designer are having a disagreement, and the reason for the disagreement is that ""she"" (the developer or the designer) likes the design.

**Conclusion**:
The pronoun ""she"" refers to the person who is doing the liking, which is the one who likes the design. This means that the antecedent of the pronoun is the designer, as it is more likely for the designer to care about the design.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down step by step!

The sentence is: ""The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person, but she was too late.""

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to a specific entity in the sentence. To identify the antecedent, we need to look for the closest noun or noun phrase that refers to the same person or thing.

* ""The investigator"" is a noun, but it's not the one the pronoun ""she"" is referring to.
* ""The witness"" is another noun, but it's also not the one ""she"" is referring to.

Now, we need to focus on the verb phrases in the sentence. The sentence has two main clauses connected by a coordinating conjunction ""but"". The first clause is ""The investigator wanted to interview the witness in person"", and the second clause is ""but she was too late"".

* In the first clause, ""the investigator"" is the subject performing the action of wanting to interview.
* In the second clause, ""she"" is the subject being described as being too late.

Based on the verb agreement and the clear description of the action, it's likely that ""she"" is referring to the witness. The witness is the one being interviewed, and the pronoun ""she"" describes their tardiness.

**Step 1: Identify the pronoun**
The pronoun is ""them"".

**Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure**

**Step 3: Identify the antecedent of the pronoun**
The pronoun ""them"" refers to the object of the first verb, which is ""the cleaner"". The guard is the one who called the cleaner, so ""them"" must refer to the cleaner.

1. The sentence is: ""Bailey planned to meet the director at his office""
2. The pronoun in this sentence is ""his"", which refers to the antecedent (the thing it replaces).

**What is the antecedent of the pronoun?**

The antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is likely the director. The sentence implies that Bailey is planning to meet the director at a location owned or controlled by the director. 

**Why is this likely?**

The use of ""at his office"" suggests that the office belongs to the director, as ""his"" is a possessive pronoun indicating ownership or control.

1. The sentence is: ""This story could not be published without the writer and their friends' support.""

2. The pronoun in question is ""their"". We need to identify what ""their"" refers to.

3. ""Their"" is a possessive pronoun, which means it is describing something that belongs to someone or something. In this case, it is describing ""friends' support"", so ""their friends"" must refer to a group of people who are associated with the writer.

4. The important question is: who are these friends associated with? Are they the writer's friends, the friends' friends, or something else?

5. Since the sentence does not provide additional context or clarification, we cannot definitively say that the friends referred to are the writer's friends. On the other hand, we also cannot say that they are the friends' friends (as in, friends who themselves have friends).

2. ""...he liked the design.""
   - Here, the pronoun ""he"" is used, referring to the subject that caused the argument. Since the argument is between the developer and the designer, the most logical candidate for ""he"" is one of these two entities.

Analyzing the options:
* (A) The developer liked the design: If we replace ""he"" with ""the developer"", the sentence would read ""The developer argued with the designer because the developer liked the design"", which might be grammatically correct but sounds awkward. This option is unlikely as the sentence suggests that the developer's liking the design caused the argument.
* (B) The designer liked the design: If we replace ""he"" with ""the designer"", the sentence would read ""The developer argued with the designer because the designer liked the design"", which makes more sense.

	* This sentence is explaining the reason why ""the cook is always teaching"" the assistant.
	* The pronoun ""they"" refers back to the entity performing the action of teaching. In this case, it is likely referring back to the cook, not the assistant. The sentence implies that the cook teaches others because they enjoy teaching.

Based on the analysis, it seems clear that the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the cook, not the assistant. The correct answer is:

1. The sentence is: ""The technician told the customer that she had completed the repair.""
2. The pronoun ""she"" is referring to...
The antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the subordinate clause ""that she had completed the repair"". This clause is a predicate nominative, which means it renames or reidentifies the subject.
3. The subject of the subordinate clause is not specified or mentioned explicitly in the sentence. However, we can infer from the context that it refers to the one who performed the repair.
4. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is most likely the technician, as the technician is the one who told the customer about the completion of the repair and is most closely associated with the repair itself.
5. Options (A) and (B) can be eliminated because the technician did not tell the customer the repair was completed by the technician, but rather reported that it was completed by someone (referring to herself, the technician).

 Sentence: The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave him a prototype.

Step 1: Identify the noun phrases in the sentence:
- The carpenter
- The designer
- him (pronoun)

Step 2: Identify the relationship between the noun phrases:
- The carpenter collaborated with the designer: This indicates that the carpenter and the designer are working together.
- gave him a prototype: This indicates that the carpenter gave something (the prototype) to someone.

Step 3: Identify the referent of the pronoun ""him"":
- The carpenter gave him a prototype: Who is ""him"" referring to? We need to find the noun phrase that is closest to the pronoun in terms of grammatical function.

Analysis:
- ""The carpenter and the designer"" is a coordinating conjunction, indicating that the carpenter and the designer are doing something together.
- The pronoun ""him"" is directly connected to the verb ""gave"" and indicates the recipient of the action.

Conclusion:
The antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is the Designer. The sentence implies that the carpenter collaborated with the designer, and then gave something (a prototype) to the designer.

1. ""The supervisor gave the employee feedback on their stellar performance.""

In this sentence, the pronoun ""their"" is used to refer to an antecedent. An antecedent is the word or phrase that the pronoun replaces.

To identify the antecedent, we need to look at the noun phrases in the sentence:

* ""The supervisor"" refers to a person who is giving feedback.
* ""the employee"" refers to the person receiving feedback.
* ""their stellar performance"" is the phrase being described.

The pronoun ""their"" is a possessive pronoun, meaning it indicates ownership or association. In this sentence, ""their"" is used to describe the performance, so the antecedent is likely the one performing.

Conclusion: The pronoun ""their"" refers to the employee, as the feedback is being given on their performance.

**Summary:** The antecedent of the pronoun ""them"" is ""the writer"".

**Step 3: Evaluate options**

Let's analyze the options:

(A) Sold the salesperson some garbage: This option is incorrect because the salesperson is the one trying to fool the writer, not being sold garbage.

(B) Sold the writer some garbage: This option is correct because the pronoun ""them"" refers to ""the writer"", who is the subject of the sentence.

Here, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" would be the subject ""the investigator"". This is clear because the sentence is describing the investigator's action.

2. ""...but he was too late.""
Now, we need to determine what or who is too late. The pronoun ""he"" is referring to one of the two entities mentioned earlier in the sentence: ""the investigator"" or ""the witness"". The sentence structure suggests that the clause describing what happened (being too late) is connected to the reason why the investigator couldn't interview the witness, which is the opposite of what the investigator wanted.

Analyzing this, I would conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is actually ""the witness"". This is because it makes more sense for the witness to be the one who was too late, rather than the investigator. If the investigator were too late, the sentence would imply that the investigator wanted to interview the witness, but the investigator didn't have time to do so due to their own tardiness, which doesn't align with the original intention.

 Sentence: This story could not be published without the writer and his friends' support.

**Step 1:** Identify the pronoun ""his"".

Antecedent of ""his"": The antecedent of ""his"" is the person or thing described as having friends. In this case, it is the writer, as indicated by the phrase ""the writer and his friends"".

**Step 2:** Identify the noun phrase ""friends' support"".

Antecedent of ""friends"": The antecedent of ""friends"" is the subject of the sentence, which is ""the writer"". This makes sense because the sentence is saying that the writer and his friends are providing support.

**Conclusion:** Based on the above analysis, we can eliminate options (B) and (C) because they refer to unnamed friends who are not the writer's friends. Option (C) is particularly problematic because ""story"" is a common noun that cannot have friends. Option (A) is the correct answer because it refers to the writer's friends, which is the only coherent interpretation of the sentence.

1. ""The mechanic greets the receptionist...""
	* The pronoun ""the receptionist"" refers to the person the mechanic is greeting. This means that ""the receptionist"" is the direct object of the verb ""greets"".
2. ""...because she is standing in front of the door.""
	* The pronoun ""she"" is used to refer to the subject of the subordinate clause ""because she is standing in front of the door"". Since the subject of this clause is not explicitly stated, we need to look for the antecedent.
3. ""She is standing in front of the door"" implies that the person being referred to is in a specific location. This makes it more likely that the person being referred to is the one who was previously mentioned as the direct object of the main clause, i.e. ""the receptionist"".
4. Given the context, it is plausible that the mechanic greets the receptionist specifically because she is standing in front of the door, suggesting that the mechanic normally greets the receptionist elsewhere, but not here.

Conclusion:
Based on the context and the pronoun's placement, the antecedent of ""she"" is most likely ""the receptionist"". Therefore, the correct answer is:

The sentence is: ""The worker told the pedestrian that she should avoid the closed portion of the street.""

First, let's identify the important phrases:

* ""The worker"" refers to the subject of the sentence, a person who is performing a task.
* ""the pedestrian"" refers to the person being addressed by the worker.
* ""that"" introduces a subordinate clause.
* ""she"" is the pronoun in question.

The key question is: who is ""she"" referring to?

Considering the context, it's likely that ""she"" refers to the ""pedestrian"", as the worker is giving advice to the pedestrian. This is a common construction in sentences, where the subject of the sentence (the worker) is giving advice to someone else, and the pronoun ""she"" refers back to that someone else (the pedestrian).

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the pedestrian.

The antecedent is the thing that the pronoun ""they"" refers to. In this sentence, it is likely that the antecedent is the subject that performed the action of ""upholding the peace"".

**Step 3: Analyze the sentence**
The sentence says ""because they uphold the peace"", which means that the sheriff protected the writer because the antecedent (upholder of the peace) upholds the peace. The antecedent must be the one that is capable of upholding the peace, which is more likely to be the one with the authority to do so.

**Conclusion**
Based on the analysis, I conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is likely (B) The writer upholds the peace. The sentence implies that the writer, not the sheriff, is the one who upholds the peace, and therefore the sheriff protected the writer because the writer does so.

* Since the sentence is discussing their discussion, we need to identify which of these two nouns is the one that is referring to in the phrase ""his favorite dishes"".

The most likely interpretation is that the pronoun ""his"" is referring to the masculine noun ""chef"". This is because ""chef"" is typically a masculine occupation, and the phrase ""favorite dishes"" is more likely to be a characteristic of a chef rather than a reporter.

**Antecedent:** The secretary (not explicitly stated, but the most logical choice). The developer is the one meeting with the secretary, so it's more plausible that the mistake being referred to is one made by the secretary, rather than the developer.

**Analysis:** Option (B) ""The secretary made a mistake"" is the most logical choice. The sentence suggests that the mistake was made by the secretary, which is why the developer met with her.

The options are:

(A) The office was the producers' office
(B) The office was Sam's office
(C) Ambiguous

To determine the antecedent, let's consider the context. We know that Sam met with the producers, and then Sam went to their office. This suggests that the producers are likely the ones who own the office, as Sam is going to their office. Therefore, it is more likely that the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is the office belonging to the producers.

 Sentence: The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told him a fake story.

**Step 1: Identify the pronoun**

The pronoun is ""him"".

**Step 2: Determine the antecedent of the pronoun**

The antecedent is the person who received the action of the verb ""told"". The verb is ""told him a fake story"", so we need to find the person who is on the receiving end of this action.

**Analysis**

The sentence includes two entities: the ""writer"" and the ""salesperson"". The writer is trying to fool the salesperson, and then tells someone a fake story. However, the sentence doesn't explicitly state who the story is being told to. It only mentions ""him"", which can refer to either the writer or the salesperson.

**Conclusion**

The antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is ambiguous. It's unclear who received the fake story. Therefore, the correct answer is:

1. ""The carpenter made a desk for the clerk and gave him a discount.""
	* The pronoun ""him"" refers to... ?

The antecedent of ""him"" is likely to be the direct object of the verb ""gave"", which is the target of the action. In this case, the direct object is either the carpenter or the clerk.
2. ""made a desk for the clerk""... This part of the sentence establishes the clerk as the intended recipient of the desk.
	* So, the carpenter made the desk for the clerk.

Now, let's analyze the second part of the sentence:
""and gave him a discount.""
	* The pronoun ""him"" is still the focus.

Since the carpenter made the desk for the clerk, it is reasonable to assume that the discount is also intended for the clerk, not the carpenter.
3. Considering the context and the fact that the carpenter made the desk for the clerk, it's more likely that the discount is given to the clerk.

Conclusion:
The antecedent of the pronoun ""him"" is the clerk.

The sentence states ""The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because she needed to understand the case.""

The phrase ""against the cashier"" indicates that the accusations are against the cashier, not the lawyer. Therefore, the pronoun ""she"" is likely referring to the **cashier**.

**Analysis:** The context suggests that the lawyer is investigating the cashier, and the reason for this is that the cashier ""needed to understand the case"". The lawyer is looking into the illegal accusations against the cashier because the cashier themselves want to understand the situation.

2. The phrase ""and they"" follows, which is a pronoun phrase referring to... (AH!) ...what? What entities does ""they"" refer to? Well, it can't refer to both the scientist and the artist, since we just introduced them separately. It can only refer to one of them, or we could argue that it's ambiguous.

Now, let's analyze our options:

(A) The scientist shares a story: This option says that the scientist is the one sharing a story, but the pronoun ""they"" has just been introduced, which is the entity performing the sharing. This syntactically feels incorrect.

(B) The artist shares a story: This option says that the artist is the one sharing a story, which is consistent with the pronoun ""they"". This feels more natural and grammatically correct.

To determine the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"", we need to find the noun or pronoun that it refers to.

The options are:

(A) The surgeon needed more rest
(B) The patient needed more rest
(C) Ambiguous

Step 1: Identify the subject of the sentence
The subject of the sentence is ""the surgeon"". This means that the surgeon is performing the action of warning.

Step 2: Identify the object of the warning
The object of the warning is ""the patient"". This means that the patient is the one being warned.

Step 3: Analyze the pronoun ""they""
The pronoun ""they"" is in the sentence ""that they needed to get more rest"". This indicates that the thing that is said to be needed for the patient is ""to get more rest"".

By analyzing the sentence, we can determine that the pronoun ""they"" refers to the patient, not the surgeon. This is because the patient is the object of the warning, and the warning is about what the patient needs to do.

Option (A) says the surgeon needed more time, but the surgeon is the one warning the nurse, so it's unlikely that the surgeon is the one who needs more time.

Option (B) says the nurse needed more time, and this is a more plausible interpretation, as the nurse is the one receiving the warning.

Option (C) says it's ambiguous, but we've already determined that the sentence is actually more specific than that.

3. To determine the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"", we need to find the noun that it refers to.
4. The sentence has two nouns: ""the worker"" and ""the pedestrian"".
5. However, ""the pedestrian"" does not agree with ""he"" in terms of gender, making it unlikely that it refers to the pedestrian.
6. Therefore, the most likely antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is ""the worker"".
7. This is because the sentence is in the passive voice, meaning that the subject of the sentence (the worker) is performing the action (telling the pedestrian something), and the object of the action (the pedestrian) is receiving the information.

1. The sentence is: ""The developer met with the secretary because they made a mistake.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" appears in the sentence.
3. What does ""they"" refer to? This is the question we're trying to answer.

Analyzing the sentence, we see that ""they"" is not a possessive pronoun, which would indicate that it refers to a noun that is also the subject of a sentence. Instead, ""they"" appears after ""because"", which means it is likely referring to someone who did something, but we don't know who that someone is yet.

4. The most likely candidates for the antecedent of ""they"" are the developer and the secretary. However, we can eliminate the developer because it was the developer who ""met with the secretary"", so it can't be the one who made a mistake afterwards.

5. We are left with the secretary as the possible antecedent of ""they"". The sentence structure implies that the developer met with the secretary because the secretary made a mistake.

6. Therefore, it is correct to conclude that the antecedent of ""they"" is indeed the secretary.

1. ""The nurse was running from the laborer""

In this part of the sentence, we learn that someone (the nurse) is running away from someone else (the laborer). So far, we don't know why the nurse is running.

2. ""because""

This word introduces the reason why the nurse is running away.

3. ""she smelled awful""

This sentence contains the pronoun ""she"", which refers to...?

Here's where things get interesting. The antecedent of ""she"" is not explicitly stated in the immediately preceding sentence. In other words, the sentence doesn't explicitly state that ""she"" refers to the nurse or the laborer. This is what makes the sentence ambiguous.

According to the grammar rules, when a pronoun is used, it typically refers to the closest antecedent (the noun or phrase that came immediately before it). In this case, the closest antecedent is the laborer, as it is the subject of the ""from"" prepositional phrase.

However, the sentence doesn't explicitly state that the laborer smells awful. It only mentions that the nurse is running away because ""she"" smells awful. This leaves room for interpretation and ambiguity.

2. ""...she sent a letter."" - The pronoun ""she"" is referring to someone, but who is it? This is where we need to analyze.

Antecedent analysis:
The antecedent is the word or phrase that the pronoun replaces. In this case, the pronoun ""she"" could be referring to either Alex or Taylor.

If ""she"" refers to Alex, it would imply that Alex sent a letter, which doesn't make sense based on the sentence. Alex didn't know Taylor until Taylor sent a letter, so it can't be Alex who sent the letter.

If ""she"" refers to Taylor, it implies that Taylor sent a letter, which is consistent with the sentence. This makes more sense, as the sentence says Alex didn't know Taylor until Taylor sent a letter.

Original sentence: The paralegal forgot to file paperwork for the client so they were fired.

Step 1: Identify the pronoun ""they"".

Step 2: Determine what ""they"" refers to.

The sentence structure suggests that ""they"" refers to the entity that performed the action (forgot to file paperwork). This entity is the paralegal. However, the sentence also mentions a client, and it's possible that ""they"" could refer to the client instead.

Step 3: Evaluate the relationship between the entities.

The paralegal is the one who forgot to file paperwork, which implies that they are the ones responsible for the action. The client is the recipient of the paperwork. The sentence doesn't suggest a direct connection between the paralegal's action and the client's fate.

Step 4: Assess the logical implications.

If the paralegal forgot to file paperwork, it's more likely that the paralegal, not the client, would be the one who got fired. This makes sense given the responsibilities involved in the action.

Step 5: Summarize the analysis.

The antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous. While it's possible to interpret ""they"" as referring to the client, the sentence structure and context suggest that it's more likely referring to the paralegal.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break down the sentence step by step.

1. The sentence is: ""The physician told the baker that he had cancer.""

2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the sentence, referring to someone or something.

3. To determine what ""he"" refers to, we need to look at the sentence structure and the grammatical relationships between the words.

4. The sentence is structured in the following way: Subject-Object-Complement-Clause (SOC-CC). Here:

* ""The physician"" is the Subject.
* ""the baker"" is the Object.
* ""that he had cancer"" is a Clause functioning as Complement.

5. The Verb ""told"" links the Subject (physician) to the Object (baker), indicating an action performed by the physician on the baker.

6. The Clause ""that he had cancer"" is a dependent clause, functioning as the direct object of the verb ""told"". This clause is an attribution, describing what the baker was told by the physician.

7. Now, examine the pronoun ""he"". Within the Clause ""that he had cancer"", it appears as the subject, referring to the one who has cancer.

8. Given the sentence structure and the implied relationships between the words, it is clear that ""he"" refers to the person told by the physician (the baker), and not the physician (as initially thought).

1. ""The patient"" is the subject of the sentence, and it refers to the person who is receiving the treatment or care.

So, the antecedent of ""they"" is... **The patient**.

2. ""had a history"" is a phrase that describes the patient, indicating that the patient has a past experience or record.

2. The pronoun ""her"" refers to the antecedent in the sentence.
3. The antecedent can be either the ""secretary"" or the ""analyst"", depending on who received the help.
4. If we read the sentence as ""the secretary received help"", it would mean that the secretary is a female who received help booking a flight. However, this seems unlikely, as secretaries are typically male.
5. On the other hand, if we read the sentence as ""the analyst received help"", it would make sense, as the analyst is typically a professional who would need assistance with booking a flight.
6. Therefore, the most likely antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is the ""analyst"".

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break down the sentence and analyze it step by step:

1. The sentence starts with ""The cleaner called the guard...""
	* ""The cleaner"" refers to a person who is cleaning something, so it's a noun phrase acting as the subject of the sentence.
	* ""the guard"" is a noun phrase acting as the object of the verb ""called"".

2. The sentence then continues with ""and asked her to open the door.""
	* The pronoun ""her"" is the object of the verb ""asked"".
	* The question is, which of the two noun phrases (""the cleaner"" and ""the guard"") does ""her"" refer to?

3. Based on the context, it's likely that ""her"" refers to the guard, as she is the one being asked to open the door. This makes sense, as the cleaner is the one doing the asking, and it would be unusual for the guard to be asked to open the door.

4. With this in mind, option (B) ""Asked the guard"" is a possible interpretation of the sentence. However, it's also possible that ""her"" refers back to ""the cleaner"", which would make the sentence mean ""The cleaner asked herself to open the door"". This is less likely, but still a potential interpretation.

5. Therefore, the answer is either (B) ""Asked the guard"" or (C) ""Ambiguous"", as the sentence could be interpreted in one of two valid ways.

2. The sentence then mentions ""the baker"", which is also a singular noun phrase.
3. The sentence also contains the pronoun ""they"", which refers back to... what?

The antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the one who had cancer. So, we need to determine whether it's the physician or the baker who had cancer.

Without additional context, it's unclear which one had cancer, so the antecedent is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct answer is:

4. The sentence doesn't mention the given name of the person called by the cousin, only the relationship ""boss"".
5. The pronoun ""her"" is referring to a female, therefore it cannot be the cousin, as the cousin is a male (""my"" indicates the speaker's relationship to the cousin).
6. This leads to two possible options:
   - (A) ""They"" (the boss's gender is not specified, but the cousin is a male, so it is possible that the boss is a female, in which case ""her"" is referring to the boss)
   - (B) Another boss, possibly a higher-level manager or superior (""the boss's boss"" option), could be the one being referred to by ""her""

3. ""she"": This is the pronoun that we're trying to understand. The antecedent of the pronoun is the one that the pronoun refers to.

4. ""needed a lab assistant"": This sentence is a rationalization for the undergraduate's action. It explains why the undergraduate applied to work with the scientist.

3. The clause following ""if"" is ""he could borrow some money"". The pronoun ""he"" in this clause must refer to the person or thing being asked if something can be done to them. In this case, the person being asked is the physician, because ""the physician"" is the object of the verb ""asked"".

**Step 2:** Identify the verb ""helped"". This verb is directed at the object ""him"".

**Step 3:** Identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""him"". Here, the antecedent is not explicitly stated in the sentence. We need to consider the most likely candidates based on the context.

A possible interpretation is that ""him"" refers to the ""analyst"", since the secretary is helping someone in the analyst's office. This would imply option (B) ""Helped the analyst book a flight"".

Another interpretation is that ""him"" could refer to the ""secretary"" themselves, meaning they are being helped by someone else. However, this interpretation seems less likely given the context.

* The pronoun ""they"" refers to the antecedent (the thing it points back to). The question is what ""they"" refers to.

Options (A) and (B) suggest that either the developer or the writer focuses on code.

**Analysis:**

In this sentence, ""they"" is a plural pronoun, but we know that there are only two people mentioned: the developer and the writer. This creates an ambiguity, as it's unclear which person is being referred to. Both options (A) and (B) are plausible, and the sentence doesn't provide enough context to disambiguate.

2. The pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the clause ""if she could borrow some money"".
3. The antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the noun phrase ""the physician"" because the sentence is asking the physician a question about lending money.
4. The sentence is asking the physician if someone (referenced by ""she"") can borrow some money. Since the sentence ends with the request ""borrow some money"", it's likely that the ""she"" refers to the person asking the question, which is the assistant.

Analysis:

The sentence is stating that the practitioner made a house call for the patient because of the patient's condition. The reason for making the house call is the patient's illness, which is indicated by the phrase ""she felt gravely ill.""

1. The sentence is: ""The physician told the baker that she had cancer.""
2. The first thing to notice is that the third-person singular pronoun ""she"" appears in the sentence. We need to determine what entity this pronoun is referring to.

From a grammatical perspective, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the relative clause ""that she had cancer"". In other words, ""she"" is referring to the entity that has cancer.

3. The sentence structure is: ""The physician told the baker that [something] had cancer"". The ""that"" clause introduces the relatable information about the entity that has cancer. Therefore, the antecedent of ""she"" is the entity being described in the ""that"" clause.

4. Since ""the baker"" is the recipient of the information being told, it's reasonable to assume that the ""that"" clause is describing the baker. In this case, the pronoun ""she"" is likely referring to the baker.

**Step 2:** Look at the options (A), (B), and (C). These options suggest that the antecedent (the thing the pronoun refers to) could be either the developer or the designer.

**Step 3:** Read the sentence again, focusing on the phrase ""they liked the design"". This phrase suggests that the person who liked the design is involved in the argument between the developer and the designer.

**Step 4:** Process the sentence further. If the developer liked the design, it wouldn't make sense for them to argue with the designer about the design because the developer is already satisfied with it.

Option (A) is plausible, as it suggests that the pathologist has their own microscope that they are using to examine the tissue samples.

Option (B) is less likely, as it would imply that the victim has a microscope that the pathologist is using, which doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.

2. The sentence then says ""...that she had been working on the house for three weeks."" - The word ""she"" refers to the subject of the relative clause ""that"". The relative clause is describing what the carpenter told the onlooker.

3. Since the carpenter is the original subject, the phrase ""she had been working on the house"" cannot refer to the carpenter, as the sentence would be saying the carpenter was telling the onlooker that the carpenter was working on the house. This doesn't make sense, as the carpenter is the one doing the telling.

4. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" must be the onlooker. The carpenter is telling the onlooker that the onlooker had been working on the house.

3. If we assume it refers to ""the manager"", it would imply that the manager asked the employee to not forget the manager's car (Option (A)).
4. However, this seems unlikely, as it would be unusual for the manager to ask the employee to remember a car belonging to the manager.
5. If we assume it refers to ""the employee"", it would mean that the manager asked the employee to not forget the employee's car (Option (B)).
6. This is a more plausible scenario, as employers often ask their employees to remember their personal belongings.
7. Given the context and the likelihood of the scenarios, it's more reasonable to assume that the antecedent of ""her"" is indeed ""the employee"".

**Analysis**: The ambiguity arises from the fact that both ""the manager"" and ""the employee"" can potentially be the referent of the pronoun ""her"".

The verb ""gave"" is in the past tense, indicating that the action of giving a discount is related to the carpenter making the desk.

**Step 4: Consider the possible antecedents**
Based on the sentence structure, it is most likely that the carpenter is the one giving the discount, since they are the ones performing the action of ""giving"". However, the sentence also mentions ""the clerk"", who may also be the recipient of the discount.

1. The sentence is: ""The construction worker called the editor and told them the whole story.""
2. The antecedent of the pronoun ""them"" is unclear. Who is the construction worker telling the whole story to?

Summary so far: The construction worker is calling someone (the editor), but it's unclear who is receiving the whole story.

3. Option (A) says ""Told the construction worker the story"". This is not possible since the pronoun ""them"" is referring to someone receiving the story, not the person telling it.

4. Option (B) says ""Told the editor the story"". This is a good candidate since the context tells us the construction worker is calling the editor, and it's possible the construction worker is telling the editor the whole story. The antecedent of ""them"" would be the editor.

Summary: The construction worker called the editor and told them the whole story.

Analysis: The sentence is clarifying that the construction worker is informing the editor about the whole story, possibly to share an experience, provide information, or update the editor on a project.

1. ""My cousin called his boss for more information""
	* The sentence states that someone's cousin called someone's boss, but we don't know who the ""his"" refers to until we examine the options.
2. ""Who is his?""
	* ""His"" is a possessive adjective modifying the noun ""boss"", indicating that the boss belongs to someone. Who is that someone?

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) ""They were my cousin's boss""
	* The antecedent of ""his"" is ""my cousin's boss"". This means that the cousin's boss is being referred to, and ""his"" correctly indicates possession.
(B) ""They were the boss's boss""
	* The antecedent of ""his"" is ""the boss's boss"". This also makes sense, as ""his"" would refer to the possessive adjective modifying the boss.
(C) ""Ambiguous""
	* But wait, what if we consider the original sentence again? The pronoun ""his"" could potentially refer to the cousin, rather than the boss. This would mean that the cousin called his own boss for more information! This possibility is not explicitly ruled out by the sentence, so the antecedent of ""his"" is indeed ambiguous.

**FIRST NOTE**: The sentence seems to be a casual, conversational sentence, so it's likely that the speaker is referring to something mentioned earlier in the conversation or context.

**Step 1: Identify the pronoun**: The pronoun is ""his"".

**Step 2: Determine the antecedent**: The antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is the noun phrase ""the developer"".

**Step 3: Analyze the sentence structure**: The sentence is structured as ""The developer met with the designer because [reason]"". This implies that the reason for the meeting is the state or fact described by the subordinate clause ""his idea can be implemented"".

**Conclusion**: Since the pronoun ""his"" is referring to the developer, the antecedent of ""his"" is the developer's idea. This means that the idea being referred to is the developer's idea, not the designer's idea.

* ""the accountant"" is the indirect object, receiving the car.
* ""a car"" is the direct object, the thing being given to the accountant.
* ""because"" is a subordinating conjunction, introducing the reason for the action.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break down the sentence step by step:

1. ""The secretary came to the analyst's office"": This phrase introduces two entities: ""the secretary"" and ""the analyst"". The analyst can be thought of as the person whose office the secretary is visiting.
2. ""and helped them to book a flight"": This phrase describes the action that the secretary took while in the analyst's office. The pronoun ""them"" is the key to unlocking the meaning of the sentence.

Antecedent of ""them"": What does ""them"" refer to? The possibilities are the secretary or the analyst.

3. Analysis: The sentence suggests that the secretary is the one performing the action of booking a flight, as it is the secretary who ""came"" to the office and took action. If the secretary were helping the analyst, the sentence might read ""The secretary came to the analyst's office and helped the analyst to book a flight"".

Conclusion: Given the context of the sentence, it's more likely that ""them"" refers to the analyst, and the secretary is helping the analyst book a flight.

The carpenter collaborated with the designer and gave her a prototype.

1. The sentence starts by introducing two individuals: ""The carpenter"" and ""the designer"". These two individuals are collaborating.
2. The action verb ""collaborated"" implies that the carpenter and the designer are working together on something.
3. The verb ""gave"" introduces a new action, which is what the carpenter is doing.
4. The object of the verb ""gave"" is the pronoun ""her"".
5. To determine what ""her"" refers to, we need to look back at the sentence and identify the nouns that could be the antecedent.

The two possible antecedents for the pronoun ""her"" are:

* The carpenter (it would be unusual to give a prototype to one's own self, but it's not impossible)
* The designer (this seems more likely, as the carpenter is supposed to be cooperating with the designer)

1. The sentence is: The surgeon warned the nurse that he needed more time to prepare.
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the sentence.

To determine the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"", we need to identify what the pronoun refers to.

3. The possible antecedents are ""the surgeon"" or ""the nurse"" (options (A) and (B), respectively).

4. The sentence structure suggests that the pronoun ""he"" is functioning as the subject of the relative clause ""that he needed more time to prepare"".

5. Given this structure, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is more likely to be ""the surgeon"", as surgeons are typically the ones who prepare for surgeries, while nurses are more likely to be involved in assisting with the process.

6. Therefore, the correct answer is that the ""he"" refers to the surgeon.

The pronoun is ""his"".

**Step 2: Determine the antecedent**
The sentence asks us to identify what ""his"" refers to. The options are the manager's car or the employee's car.

**Step 3: Analyze the context**
The sentence is a request from the manager to the employee. The manager is asking the employee not to forget something. Given the structure of the sentence, it seems unlikely that the manager would be asking the employee to forget something belonging to the manager.

**Step 4: Make an inference**
Based on the context, it's more likely that the manager is asking the employee to remember or not forget something that belongs to the employee.

**Step 5: Choose the correct answer**
Given the analysis and inference, the correct answer is that the pronoun ""his"" refers to the employee's car.

2. The pronoun is ""their"", which refers to the antecedent in the sentence.

The question is: what or who is the antecedent of ""their""?

a. The word ""cousin"" comes after ""my"", but it's not logical that ""cousin"" would have a boss, as a cousin is a family member.

b. The closest noun related to ""boss"" is ""boss"", which is the direct object of the verb ""called"".

1. The sentence states: ""The chief encouraged the writer because he wrote a good book.""
2. The pronoun ""he"" appears in the sentence, and it's referring to the antecedent.

Question: What does ""he"" refer to?

To answer this, we need to look at the options:

(A) The chief wrote a good book
(B) The writer wrote a good book
(C) Ambiguous

Based on the sentence structure and grammar, it's clear that ""he"" is more likely to refer to the one who wrote a good book, as the clause ""because he wrote a good book"" specifies the reason for the chief's encouragement.

Since the sentence is stating that the chief encouraged the writer, it's more probable that the chief is not the one who wrote the good book (as they are the one doing the encouraging).

Therefore, the most logical choice is:

Sentence: Before she sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor.
Options:
(A) Alex sent the letter
(B) Taylor sent the letter
(C) Ambiguous
End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break down the sentence step by step.

Sentence: Before she sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor.

To start, we need to identify the pronoun ""she"". The antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is actually not explicitly stated, as the pronoun is referring to a person who is not named in the sentence. Since there are only two entities mentioned in the sentence, Alex and Taylor, we can assume that ""she"" is referring to one of them.

Next, we know that Alex did not know Taylor before something happened (the letter being sent). This implies that the letter being sent is something that changed Alex's state of knowledge regarding Taylor.

Now, we have three options:

(A) Alex sent the letter
(B) Taylor sent the letter
(C) Ambiguous

Let's analyze each option:

(A) If Alex sent the letter, then it's likely that ""she"" refers to Alex. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that sending the letter caused Alex to know Taylor. The sentence only says that Alex didn't know Taylor before the letter was sent, but not that the letter caused Alex to know Taylor.

(B) If Taylor sent the letter, then it's still unclear who ""she"" refers to. It could refer to Taylor, but it would be an unusual antecedent, as ""she"" is usually a substitute for a previously mentioned noun. Alternatively, it could refer back to Alex, but that would mean that the sentence implies Alex sent the letter, which contradicts the option.

(C) Given the ambiguity, option (C) Ambiguous is a reasonable choice, as the sentence doesn't provide clear enough context to determine who sent the letter and what ""she"" refers to.

Sentence: The driver yelled at the tailor after they broke a window.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down step by step.

1. The sentence is: ""The driver yelled at the tailor after they broke a window.""
2. The pronoun ""they"" refers to the antecedent that performed the action of breaking the window.
3. The phrase ""the driver"" refers to a person who drove a vehicle, and the phrase ""the tailor"" refers to a person who deals with fabrics, such as sewing or altering clothes.
4. We need to determine whether it was the driver or the tailor who broke the window.

Now, let's analyze the sentence:

* ""The driver yelled at the tailor"" introduces a conflict between the driver and the tailor.
* ""after they broke a window"" is the reason for the driver's anger.

Given this context, it's likely that the driver was upset because someone broke their window. It could be either the driver or the tailor, but based on the sentence's structure, it seems more plausible that the driver broke the window.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is likely the driver.

 Sentence: The secretary corrected the developer because he better understood the problem.

1. ""The secretary corrected the developer"" - This clause establishes the action of the secretary correcting the developer.
2. ""because"" - This word introduces the cause for the correction.
3. ""he better understood the problem"" - This clause provides the reason for the correction.

To identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"", we need to ask which entity in the sentence is not the subject, but is instead the entity that did the understanding.

The two entities in the sentence are ""the secretary"" and ""the developer"". Since the secretary is the one performing the action of correcting, it's unlikely that ""he"" refers to the secretary.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is likely the developer, who is the entity that better understood the problem.
