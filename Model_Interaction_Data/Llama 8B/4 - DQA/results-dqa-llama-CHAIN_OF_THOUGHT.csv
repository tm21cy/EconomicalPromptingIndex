The sentence is: ""The patient was referred to the specialist because he had a rare skin condition.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

To find the antecedent, we need to identify what the pronoun refers to.

The word ""he"" is referring to the subject of the sentence, which is ""the patient"". The sentence is stating that the patient was referred to the specialist because the patient had a rare skin condition.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is ""the patient"".

* The sentence has two nouns: ""scientist"" and ""artist"".
* The phrase ""he"" is the pronoun.
* To find the antecedent of the pronoun, we need to see which noun it refers to.

The sentence is: ""The developer argued with the designer because she liked the design.""

The pronoun is ""she"", and it refers to the antecedent, which is the person who liked the design.

The sentence starts with ""The developer argued with the designer"", so the developer is the one arguing with the designer.

The reason for the argument is ""because she liked the design"", which indicates that the person who liked the design is the reason for the argument.

The only possessor of the trait ""liked the design"" mentioned in the sentence is the designer. Since the designer is the one being argued with, it's unlikely that the developer is the one who liked the design.

The pronoun ""she"" is referring to a noun in the sentence. We need to find the noun that ""she"" is referring to.

The nouns in the sentence are:

* The investigator
* The witness

The pronoun ""she"" is a feminine pronoun, so it's more likely to refer to ""the witness"", as ""the investigator"" is a male noun (implies a masculine investigator, unless it's explicitly stated as a female investigator).

The pronoun ""he"" appears after the conjunction ""and"", which indicates that it refers back to one of the entities mentioned earlier in the sentence.

The two entities mentioned earlier are ""the scientist"" and ""the artist"". Since ""he"" appears after ""and"", it can't refer to ""and"" itself, so it must refer to one of the two entities.

Now, let's consider the options:

(A) The scientist shares a story - This option implies that the scientist is the one who shares a story, but the sentence doesn't specify which one shares a story. The scientist collaborates with the artist, but it's not mentioned that the scientist shares a story.

(B) The artist shares a story - This option is also plausible, as the sentence could mean that the artist shares a story with the scientist.

(C) Ambiguous - Since the sentence doesn't specify which entity shares the story, the pronoun ""he"" could potentially refer to either the scientist or the artist. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous.

The verb is ""discuss"", which takes an object: ""his culinary training"".

The pronoun ""his"" refers to the possessive owner of the culinary training. Attention is needed because there are two subjects, ""the customer"" and ""the chef"".

Which subject is more likely to have impressive culinary training?

In a typical restaurant setting, the chef would be more likely to have undergone culinary training, as it is part of their profession.

* ""The scientist"" is a noun phrase that refers to another person.
* ""he"" is the pronoun in question.

The pronoun ""he"" follows the phrase ""because"", which indicates a reason for the action. In this sentence, it is because ""he"" needed something that the undergraduate applied to work with the scientist.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the undergraduate. It is the undergraduate who needed a lab assistant, which led them to apply to work with the scientist.

Therefore, I conclude that:

""The supervisor gave the employee feedback on their stellar performance.""

The pronoun is ""their"". We need to find the antecedent, which is the noun that ""their"" refers to.

The sentence has two potential antecedents: ""the supervisor"" and ""the employee"".

Both ""the supervisor"" and ""the employee"" can be considered as the potential antecedents, as they both have a possessive relationship with the word ""their"". The supervisor may have given feedback on their own performance, or the employee may have received feedback on their performance.

Since the sentence does not provide sufficient context to disambiguate the antecedent, we cannot uniquely identify the pronoun ""their"". Therefore, the correct answer is:

The sentence starts with ""The salesperson..."". This introduces the subject of the first clause, which is the salesperson.

The next phrase is ""tried to fool the writer..."". This introduces the subject of the second clause, which is the writer.

The conjunction ""and"" connects the two clauses, indicating that they are related.

We can eliminate ""teacher"" because the sentence says ""the teacher that he liked the cake"", indicating that the teacher is the one who is being told, not the one who liked the cake.

That leaves us with ""visitor"". The sentence says ""The visitor told the teacher that he liked the cake"", so it's logical to conclude that the visitor is the one who liked the cake.

	* The sentence doesn't mention anything that would suggest the scientist is sharing a story, but rather implies that the artist will share a story (the verb ""collaborate"" implies a shared activity, and ""share a story"" specifically refers to the artist).

The pronoun in this sentence is ""his"", which is referring to someone's grading policy.

The sentence mentions two individuals: the educator and the student. We need to figure out which one ""his"" is referring to.

The noun phrase ""his grading policy"" is in the possessive form, indicating that it belongs to someone. In English, the pronoun ""his"" usually refers to a male noun it is modifying, while ""hers"" usually refers to a female noun.

In this sentence, we don't have any information about the educator's gender, but we do know that the student is referred to with the indefinite article ""a"", which is typically used for a singular noun. This doesn't give us enough information to determine the student's gender, but it's possible that the student is male, making ""his"" a likely choice to refer to the student's grading policy.

So, based on the grammar and the available information, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is likely the student. However, we can't rule out the possibility that the educator is male, making ""his"" refer to the educator's grading policy.

However, the phrase ""Alexander tells us that [..] them"" would not make sense, as it's unlikely that someone is telling us about someone else's inability to meet.

The closest option to a plural noun is the phrase ""us"", which is a subject pronoun, but it's not a suitable antecedent for ""they"" either, as it's not a thing that can meet.

Given these constraints, the antecedent is ambiguous. ""They"" could potentially refer to ""Alex"" (despite the mismatch in number) or to some other entity that has not been mentioned in the sentence.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down:

* ""The reporter and the chef"" is a noun phrase consisting of two names (entities).
* The verb ""discussed"" requires a subject, which is ""they"" (the reporter and the chef).
* The pronoun ""his"" appears, which refers to the subject ""they"".

Now, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"". The antecedent is the noun or pronoun that the pronoun refers to.

In this case, ""his"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating ownership or possession. Since ""they"" (the reporter and the chef) is a plural noun phrase, we can't assume that the possessive pronoun ""his"" refers to only one of the entities (either the reporter or the chef). Instead, the pronoun ""his"" could potentially refer to either the reporter or the chef, as both are being discussed.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is ambiguous.

The subject of the sentence is ""that he should avoid the closed portion of the street"", but this is a subordinate clause, which is the object of the verb ""told"". Therefore, the subject of the main clause is either ""the worker"" or ""the pedestrian"".

The sentence starts with ""After meeting with the producers"", which indicates that Sam is the one who is meeting with the producers. After doing so, he decides to go to someone's office.

Now, we have two possibilities:

1. The office belongs to Sam himself. This would mean that the antecedent of ""their"" is ""Sam's"".

Then, it says ""and gave him some tips"", which indicates that the subject (The chief) is giving something to someone/something.

Now, we need to find out who ""him"" refers to. The most reasonable interpretation is that ""him"" refers to the one who was thanked earlier in the sentence - the housekeeper. This is because the introduction of ""and"" implies a continuation of the same action, which is giving, to the same person who was thanked.

2. The pronoun is ""he"".
3. The verb associated with the pronoun is ""sent"".
4. The antecedent of the pronoun is the one that is closely related to the verb ""sent"".

To find the antecedent, we need to look at the sentence structure:

* ""Alex"" is the subject who doesn't know something.
* ""until"" is a preposition indicating the condition.
* ""he sent a letter"" is the clause that is the condition, implying that Alex started knowing Taylor after some event.

Here's the crucial part: the verb ""sent"" is linked to the subject ""he"", not ""Alex"". So, the antecedent of ""he"" is actually ""some entity"" that performed the action of sending the letter.

Now, from the given options:

* (A) Alex sent the letter: This doesn't match, as the sentence tells us that Alex didn't know Taylor until he sent a letter, implying that Alex didn't send the letter.
* (B) Taylor sent the letter: This could fit, as the sentence doesn't explicitly state who sent the letter, leaving that information implicit.
* (C) Ambiguous: We can't definitively say who sent the letter, but the sentence structure implies that it was someone other than Alex, possibly Taylor. Hence, the options are not mutually exclusive.

The antecedent is likely ""the developer"", as it is the subject of the sentence and ""he"" is a common pronoun used to refer to a male subject.

Now, let's consider the possibilities:

A) ""They discuss the reporter's favorite dishes""

In this option, ""they"" refers to ""the reporter and the chef"", which is the subject of the sentence. However, the pronoun ""her"" does not match the antecedent ""they"", as ""they"" is a plural pronoun and ""her"" is a singular pronoun.

B) ""They discuss the chef's favorite dishes""

In this option, ""they"" still refers to ""the reporter and the chef"". The pronoun ""her"" could potentially refer to the chef, as ""her"" is a singular pronoun that agrees with the chef, a singular noun.

C) ""Ambiguous""

This option is correct because the sentence is indeed ambiguous. It is unclear whether the pronoun ""her"" refers to the reporter or the chef. The sentence does not provide enough information to disambiguate the antecedent.

Comparing the options, we can see that:

The pronoun is ""her"".

To find the antecedent, we need to identify the noun that ""her"" refers to.

The options are:

1. Ask ""the designer"" (which is a feminine noun), so ""her"" refers to the designer.
2. Ask ""the janitor"" (also a feminine noun), so ""her"" refers to the janitor.

(C) Ambiguous

The pronoun ""he"" is a subject pronoun, so it must refer to a noun in the sentence. The two possible nouns are ""the technician"" and ""the customer"".

Since the sentence is saying that someone (he) had completed the repair, it's more likely that the technician is the one who did the repair. The customer would not typically be the one completing repairs.

* ""That"" is a subordinate clause introducing the information being shared.

The pronoun ""they"" can be referring to either the paralegal ( ""(A) The paralegal was fired"" ) or the client ( ""(B) The client was fired"" ).

The subject of the sentence is ""the laborer"", and the object is ""the secretary"". The sentence describes an action done by the laborer to the secretary.

The phrase ""because they asked for a tool"" is a subordinate clause, which explains why the laborer handed the secretary a hammer. The pronoun ""they"" is referring to the person or entity that performed the action of asking for a tool.

* The phrase ""that he had cancer"" is a subordinate clause that provides more information about what the physician told the baker.
* The subject of this subordinate clause is ""he"", which is a pronoun.

Now, the question is: what does ""he"" refer to? The answer is not explicitly stated, but we can use context and logic to figure it out. Since the sentence is telling us about the physician and the baker, it's likely that ""he"" refers to one of these two individuals.

The sentence says: ""The nurse stayed away from the laborer because she was very busy.""

The word ""she"" refers to the person whose occupation affects the situation. In this case, ""she"" refers to the person who is busy.

The sentence doesn't explicitly state who is busy, but we can infer that it's the nurse who is busy, not the laborer. This is because the nurse is the one staying away, and it's the nurse's busy schedule that's the reason for this action.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is the nurse.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break down the sentence step by step.

The sentence is: ""The reporter and the chef will discuss his favorite dishes.""

The pronoun is ""his"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify what type of noun ""his"" is modifying.

The sentence has two nouns: ""reporter"" and ""chef"". ""His"" is not directly modifying either of these nouns, as it's not in a possessive relationship with them (e.g., ""the reporter's favorite dishes"").

However, the sentence implies that one of these two individuals has favorite dishes. Since ""his"" is not modifying either ""reporter"" or ""chef"", it suggests that ""his"" is likely referring to a singular noun that is part of the subject phrase ""The reporter and the chef"".

The plural subject phrase ""The reporter and the chef"" is functioning as a single unit, with ""and"" indicating that they are in a relationship (in this case, discussing favorite dishes). Therefore, ""his"" is most likely referring to the individual represented by the plural subject phrase.

In this case, we can't definitively say whether ""his"" refers to the reporter or the chef, as it could be either one. This is because the sentence doesn't provide any additional context to disambiguate the reference.

The embedded clause ""that he should floss every day"" is describing the information that the hygienist told the patient.

The sentence is ""The hygienist told the patient that they should floss every day.""

We need to find the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"".

The antecedent is the noun or phrase that the pronoun replaces.

In this sentence, the options for the antecedent are ""The hygienist"" and ""the patient"".

The sentence structure suggests that the subject of the sentence (""The hygienist"") is performing the action of telling, and the object of the sentence (""the patient"") receives the advice.

The pronoun ""they"" is the object of the sentence ""that they should floss every day"", which is the complement of the sentence ""The hygienist told the patient that..."".

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is ""the patient"".

The antecedent is the noun that ""their"" refers to.

The nouns in the sentence are ""customer"" and ""chef"".

Both ""customer"" and ""chef"" have the possessive form ""their"", which makes it ambiguous.

The CEO is the one doing the buying, but it doesn't make sense to say that the CEO needed a car. CEOs are expected to already have cars, or at least be able to afford one.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break down the sentence step by step.

The sentence is: ""The CEO bought the accountant a car because they needed one.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

The sentence implies that the reason the CEO bought the accountant a car is because the accountant (or possibly the CEO) needed one.

Since the sentence doesn't explicitly state who needed the car, we have to make an inference based on the context.

The subject of the sentence is ""The CEO"", and the object is ""the accountant"". The verb ""bought"" indicates that the CEO is performing the action of buying the car for the accountant. The purpose clause ""because they needed one"" provides the reason for the CEO's action.

Given this context, we can reasonably infer that ""they"" refers to the accountant, as the sentence suggests that the CEO bought the car for the accountant. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the accountant.

Hence, the correct answer is:

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down step by step!

The pronoun ""them"" refers to the person or thing that has taken an action previously mentioned in the sentence. In this case, the action is ""came to the analyst's office and helped"".

The sentence states that the secretary came to the analyst's office, which means the secretary is the one who performed the action of coming.

However, the pronoun ""them"" is used to refer to the recipient of the action ""helped"", which means the pronoun ""them"" should refer to the one who was helped, not the one who helped.

Given the context, it's more likely that the secretary helped the analyst, as the analyst's office is mentioned prior to the helping action.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(A) Gave the carpenter a prototype
(B) Gave the designer a prototype
(C) Ambiguous
End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break it down:

* The sentence says ""The carpenter collaborated with the designer...""
* This establishes the carpenter and the designer as two separate entities.
* The sentence then says ""and gave her a prototype.""
* The pronoun ""her"" must refer to one of these two entities.
* Since there are only two possibilities (the carpenter or the designer), one of them must be the antecedent of the pronoun.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun is the designer.

193,"In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The surgeon warned the nurse that he needed more time to prepare.
Options:
(A) The surgeon needed more time
(B) The nurse needed more time
(C) Ambiguous
End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's analyze the sentence:

""The surgeon warned the nurse that he needed more time to prepare.""

The pronoun ""he"" is referring to the subject of the subordinate clause ""that he needed more time to prepare"". This clause is describing the reason why the surgeon is warning the nurse.

Since the subject of the subordinate clause is not explicitly stated, we need to look for the closest noun phrase that could be the subject. In this case, it is ""he"", which is a pronoun. The most likely antecedent for ""he"" is the one that is parallel in grammatical function to the subject of the main clause.

The subject of the main clause is ""the surgeon"", which is a singular noun. Therefore, it is likely that the antecedent of ""he"" is also singular.

In this sentence, ""he"" is more naturally referring to ""the surgeon"" than ""the nurse"", as it is the surgeon who is preparing for the operation and needs more time.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break down the sentence step by step:

* The sentence says ""The manager asked the employee to not forget his car.""
* The pronoun ""his"" refers to the possessor of the car.
* The subject of the sentence is ""the manager"", and it is not the possessor of the car.
* The other possible subject is ""the employee"", but it is also not the possessor of the car.
* Therefore, the pronoun ""his"" must refer to someone other than the manager or the employee.

Given these facts, the only other option is that ""his"" refers to someone else who happens to own a car. This could be the manager's car, the employee's car, or even someone else's car altogether.

Since we cannot definitively determine the antecedent of the pronoun, the correct answer is:

""My cousin called their boss for more information""

The pronoun is ""their"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify what ""their"" is referring to.

The word ""boss"" appears twice in the sentence, but it's not clear which ""boss"" is being referred to by ""their"".

The antecedent could be ""my cousin's boss"", meaning the boss of the person described as the speaker's cousin.

OR

The antecedent could be ""the boss"", implying that ""their"" is referring to a new, separate boss, not necessarily the boss of the speaker's cousin.

Therefore, the answer is:

""The chief encouraged the writer because he wrote a good book.""

The pronoun ""he"" refers to the thing that performed the action of writing a good book. In this sentence, ""he"" could either refer to ""the chief"" or ""the writer"".

The chief did not write the book, but they encouraged the writer who did write the book. Therefore, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to ""the writer"".

However, it's not entirely clear-cut, and some might argue that the sentence is ambiguous. But based on the context, it seems more sensible that ""he"" refers to ""the writer"".

The sentence says ""Before she sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor.""

The key phrase is ""she sent the letter"". The pronoun ""she"" is what we're looking for.

The antecedent of ""she"" should be the subject of the sentence that comes before it, which is ""Alex"". However, ""she"" is actually referring to Taylor, since the sentence says ""Before she sent the letter, Alex did not know Taylor."".

In other words, the sentence is saying that Alex didn't know Taylor until Taylor sent the letter. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The sentence is: The driver yelled at the tailor after they broke a window.

The pronoun is ""they"".

The sentence says that the driver yelled at the tailor, so we can infer that the driver is not the one being yelled at. Therefore, ""they"" must refer to the person who broke the window.

But who is that person? Is it the driver or the tailor? The sentence doesn't specifically state which one, so we can't conclude that ""they"" refers to only one person.

To find the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"", we need to identify what noun or noun phrase it refers to. In this sentence, ""he"" is the subject of the verb ""better understood"".

The sentence does not explicitly mention a specific noun or noun phrase before ""he"", but we can look for the context and the options provided.

The options are:

(A) The secretary understood the problem
(B) The developer understood the problem
(C) Ambiguous

Based on the sentence structure and the options, it is more likely that ""he"" refers to the developer. The sentence is saying that the secretary corrected the developer because the developer (not the secretary) better understood the problem.
