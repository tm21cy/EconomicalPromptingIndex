Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.

Of all the band of adventurous cavaliers, whom Spain, in the sixteenth century, sent forth on the career of discovery and conquest, there was none more deeply filled with the spirit of romantic enterprise than Hernando Cortes. Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.… He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.… This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.… He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; … wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!

It is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community. It is a place where man can renew contact with nature. It is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what it adds to the understanding of the race. It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods.

He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . .

193,"Over the last several years, the economy of a state has substantially changed. The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill?

First, let\'s understand what ""adverse impact"" means in personnel selection:\n   It\'s a legal concept that refers to employment practices that appear neutral but have a discriminatory effect on a protected group.\n\n2. Now, let\'s analyze each option:\n\n   A) This option states that a protected group is hired at a rate less than 80% of the group with the best selection rate. This is actually the correct definition of the ""80% rule"" or ""four-fifths rule"" used to determine adverse impact.\n\n   B) This option suggests that interviews themselves are adverse for protected groups. This is not correct, as adverse impact refers to the results of the selection process, not the process itself.\n\n   C) This option is too vague and doesn\'t accurately describe adverse impact. It doesn\'t mention anything about differential selection rates.\n\n   D) While this option mentions unequal results, it doesn\'t specify the 80% rule, which is a key component of determining adverse impact.\n\n3. After analyzing all options, A is the most accurate and complete definition of adverse impact as used in personnel selection.\n\nFinal Answer = ((A))', type='text')]",(A),159,257

Option C (increased immigration) wasn't a major factor in Lincoln's opposition to southward expansion.\n\n7. Option B, however, directly relates to Lincoln's well-documented stance against the spread of slavery.\n\n8.

Mutation (A):\n   - While viruses do mutate, this alone doesn\'t explain why they ""continue to plague us.""\n   - Mutation is a factor in virus evolution, but it\'s not the primary reason for emergence.\n\n2. Disturbing forests and zoonosis (B):\n   - Many emerging viruses originate in animals (zoonosis).\n   - Human encroachment into natural habitats increases contact with these viruses.\n   - Deforestation and urbanization bring humans closer to wildlife reservoirs.\n   - This explanation addresses why these viruses are newly affecting humans.\n\n3. Mosquitoes (C):\n   - While mosquitoes are important vectors for some viruses (like Zika), they\'re not the main cause for all emerging viruses.\n   - Ebola, for instance, is not spread by mosquitoes.\n\n4. Vaccines (D):\n   - Vaccines are a response to viruses, not a cause of their emergence.\n   - The statement that viruses ""can be halted by new vaccines"" is hopeful but doesn\'t explain why they plague us in the first place.\n\nConsidering these points, the most comprehensive and accurate explanation for why emerging viruses continue to plague us is that we are disturbing their natural habitats and coming into contact with them.

(A).","[TextBlock(text='Let\'s approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. Astroviruses are primarily known as gastrointestinal pathogens, causing gastroenteritis in humans and animals.\n\n2. Their main site of replication is the intestinal tract, particularly in the epithelial cells of the small intestine.\n\n3. While they can cause significant diarrheal disease, their replication is not typically described as ""very restricted"" in the gut. In fact, they can replicate quite effectively in intestinal cells.\n\n4. There have been rare reports of astrovirus infections in the central nervous system, but this is not considered their essential or typical pathology.\n\n5. Astroviruses do have genetic diversity, with multiple serotypes identified. This diversity contributes to their ability to infect various host species and potentially evade immune responses.\n\n6. While some respiratory symptoms have been reported in some cases, astroviruses are not typically associated with upper respiratory tract infections. Their primary target remains the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n7. The genetic diversity and ability to replicate effectively in the intestinal tract are key features of astrovirus pathology.\n\nConsidering these points, the answer that best describes the essential pathology of astroviruses is related to their sequence diversity allowing widespread replication.\n\nFinal Answer = ((C))', type='text')]",(A),120,291
