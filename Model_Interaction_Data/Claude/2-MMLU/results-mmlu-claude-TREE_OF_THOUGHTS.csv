Let's start by checking if the polynomial has any roots in Z_3 for each value of c.\n\nExpert 3: Agreed. For a cubic polynomial to be irreducible in Z_3, it must not have any roots in Z_3.

For c = 0 and c = 2, the polynomial has no roots in Z_3.\n\nExpert 2: For c = 0 and c = 2, we've shown that the polynomial has no linear factors. To be irreducible, it must also not be the product of two linear factors. \n\nExpert 3: Since we're working in Z_3 and the polynomial is of degree 3, if it's not irreducible, it must have a linear factor.

A prime ideal is an ideal P such that if ab ∈ P, then either a ∈ P or b ∈ P.\n\nExpert 2 (Ring Theorist):\nStep 1: I agree with the definitions. To address Statement 1, we need to prove that every maximal ideal is indeed a prime ideal. This is a well-known theorem in ring theory.\n\nExpert 3 (Field Theorist):\nStep 1: For Statement 2, we should consider the definition of a field. A field is a commutative ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. We need to show that R/I satisfies this property when I is maximal.\n\nExpert 1 (Algebraist):\nStep 2: To prove Statement 1, let M be a maximal ideal in a ring R. Suppose ab ∈ M but a ∉ M and b ∉ M. Then (M + aR) = R and (M + bR) = R because M is maximal. This means 1 = m1 + ar = m2 + bs for some m1, m2 ∈ M and r, s ∈ R.\n\nExpert 2 (Ring Theorist):\nStep 2: Continuing from Expert 1's reasoning, multiplying these equations, we get 1 = (m1 + ar)(m2 + bs) = m1m2 + m1bs + arm2 + arbs. Since ab ∈ M, arbs ∈ M, and m1m2, m1bs, arm2 ∈ M, we have 1 ∈ M. This contradicts M being a proper ideal. Thus, M must be prime.\n\nExpert 3 (Field Theorist):\nStep 2: For Statement 2, let I be a maximal ideal of R. To show R/I is a field, we need to prove that every non-zero element in R/I has a multiplicative inverse. Let a + I be a non-zero element in R/I. This means a ∉ I.\n\nExpert 1 (Algebraist):\nStep 3: Statement 1 is proven true. For Statement 2, continuing from Expert 3's reasoning, since I is maximal and a ∉ I, we know that I + aR = R. This means there exist i ∈ I and r ∈ R such that 1 = i + ar.\n\nExpert 2 (Ring Theorist):\nStep 3: I agree with the proofs for both statements. Statement 1 is true because we've shown every maximal ideal is prime. Statement 2 is also true, as Expert 1's last step shows that a has an inverse modulo I, making R/I a field.\n\nExpert 3 (Field Theorist):\nStep 3: I concur. The equation 1 = i + ar implies that ar ≡ 1 (mod I), which means r + I is the multiplicative inverse of a + I in R/I.

The elements of R/I are cosets of I in R.\n\nExpert 2 (Ring Theorist):\nStep 1: For Statement 1, I agree with Expert 1's approach. Let's also recall that the operations in a quotient ring are defined based on the operations in the original ring.\n\nExpert 3 (Number Theorist):\nStep 1: For Statement 1, I concur with Experts 1 and 2. Let's also remember that commutativity is preserved under homomorphisms, and there's a natural homomorphism from R to R/I.\n\nExpert 1 (Algebraist):\nStep 2: For Statement 1, given that R is commutative, for any a + I and b + I in R/I, we have (a + I)(b + I) = ab + I = ba + I = (b + I)(a + I). This proves that R/I is commutative if R is commutative.\n\nExpert 2 (Ring Theorist):\nStep 2: I agree with Expert 1's proof for Statement 1. Now, for Statement 2, let's consider the definition of an ideal. An ideal N of a ring R is a subring of R that absorbs multiplication by elements of R.\n\nExpert 3 (Number Theorist):\nStep 2: I agree with both experts so far. For Statement 2, let's also recall that in a ring with unity, the unity element 1 is the multiplicative identity for all elements of the ring.\n\nExpert 1 (Algebraist):\nStep 3: For Statement 2, if N = R, then clearly 1 ∈ N.

This operation is performed log n times during the recursion, potentially leading to O(n log n) time just for splitting.\n\nExpert 1:\nStep 2: Based on the insights from Experts 2 and 3, it seems that arrays are suitable for O(n log n) mergesort, while linked lists might pose challenges due to the splitting operation.\n\nExpert 2:\nStep 2: For linked lists, while merging can be done efficiently by adjusting pointers, the splitting operation is indeed problematic as pointed out by Expert 3. This applies to both singly and doubly linked lists.\n\nExpert 3:\nStep 2: Agreeing with Experts 1 and 2, arrays allow for efficient splitting and merging, maintaining the O(n log n) time complexity. Linked lists, however, don't support this due to the O(n) splitting operation at each recursive level.\n\nExpert 1:\nStep 3: Given our collective analysis, it appears that only arrays support mergesort in O(n log n) time among the given options.\n\nExpert 2:\nStep 3: I concur.

A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. In this case, we\'re dealing with a 99% confidence interval.\n\nExpert 2: I agree. The key aspect of a confidence interval is that it\'s about estimating the true population parameter, not about hypothesis testing. This immediately rules out options C and D, which are related to hypothesis testing and not confidence intervals.\n\nExpert 3: That\'s correct. Now we need to distinguish between options A and B. The crucial difference is whether the interval contains the true value of the parameter or the estimated value of the parameter.\n\nExpert 1: For the next step, let\'s consider what ""99% of the time in repeated samples"" means. This refers to the long-run frequency interpretation of confidence intervals. If we were to repeat the sampling process many times and construct a 99% confidence interval each time, about 99% of these intervals would contain the true population parameter.\n\nExpert 2: Exactly. The confidence interval is constructed around the sample statistic (the estimate), but its purpose is to capture the true population parameter. The estimated value will always be in the interval because it\'s the center point of the interval\'s construction.\n\nExpert 3: I concur. The goal of a confidence interval is to estimate the range where the true population parameter lies, not to capture the sample estimate (which we already know). Therefore, the correct definition must refer to the true value of the parameter, not the estimated value.\n\nExpert 1: Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that option A is the most appropriate definition of a 99% confidence interval. It correctly states that the interval would contain the true value of the parameter 99% of the time in repeated samples.\n\nExpert 2: I agree with this conclusion.

Read the following quote.
I had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .
Such are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.

Additionally, we should consider that in the long run, firms can adjust all factors of production. For a monopoly, this means they can optimize their production scale to maximize profits.\n\nExpert 3: Building on these points, we should also remember that a profit-maximizing monopoly will produce at the quantity where MR = MC.

When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.… This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.… He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; … wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them.

However, we should also consider that international tribunals are created differently from national courts, often through treaties or by international organizations. This might affect their jurisdictional principles.\n\nExpert 3: Good points. I'd like to add that we should look at specific examples of international tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court (ICC) or the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to see how their jurisdiction is determined and compare it to national courts.\n\nExpert 1: Examining specific international tribunals is a good idea. The ICC, for instance, has jurisdiction over specific crimes (genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression) committed by individuals. This is similar to subject matter jurisdiction in national courts, but more limited in scope.\n\nExpert 2: Building on that, the ICJ's jurisdiction is based on state consent, which is quite different from national courts. States must agree to the ICJ's jurisdiction, either through special agreement or by accepting the court's compulsory jurisdiction. This suggests that not all jurisdictional principles are shared between national and international courts.\n\nExpert 3: I agree with both points.

Additionally, it's important to note that research has shown the involvement of specific proteins in fatty acid uptake, suggesting a more complex mechanism than simple diffusion alone.\n\nExpert 3: Both experts make valid points. To add to this, the proteins involved in fatty acid uptake include fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), and fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs). These proteins facilitate the movement of fatty acids across the cell membrane.\n\nExpert 1: Building on our collective observations, it seems that the uptake of NEFAs involves both passive diffusion and protein-mediated transport. This combination of mechanisms allows for more efficient and regulated fatty acid uptake compared to diffusion alone.\n\nExpert 2: I concur with Expert 1.

However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill?

Given that Krauthammer was discussing the post-Cold War era, this likely refers to the United States as the sole remaining superpower after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nExpert 2: I agree with Expert 1\'s interpretation of ""unipolar."" The word ""moment"" in this context suggests a temporary or fleeting period, implying that Krauthammer didn\'t see this as a permanent state of affairs. This rules out option D, which suggests ""never-ending domination.""\n\nExpert 3: Building on what has been said, Krauthammer\'s use of ""moment"" indeed implies a temporary situation. This aligns with the idea that the collapse of the Soviet Union created a unique opportunity for the United States. It\'s not about sharing power (A) or facing no threats (C), but rather about the US having a chance to extend its influence.\n\nExpert 1: Considering the experts\' points, I believe we can conclude that Krauthammer was referring to a temporary period where the US had the opportunity to extend its power and influence globally, following the collapse of its main rival, the Soviet Union. This aligns most closely with option B.\n\nExpert 2: I concur with Expert 1\'s conclusion. The ""unipolar moment"" refers to the unique opportunity the US had to shape the global order after emerging as the sole superpower.

The southward expansion of the US at that time would likely have involved new slave states, which Lincoln opposed on moral and political grounds.\n\nExpert 3: You're both right to focus on slavery. Lincoln's primary concern with southward expansion was indeed related to the spread of slavery, which he viewed as morally wrong and politically destabilizing.\n\nExpert 1: Moving to step 2, we can eliminate option A, as economic concerns were not Lincoln's primary motivation for opposing southward expansion.

Zika and Ebola are both zoonotic diseases, meaning they originate in animals and can be transmitted to humans. This points towards option B as a strong contender.\n\nExpert 2:\nStep 1: I agree that the zoonotic nature of these viruses is crucial. However, we should also consider the role of mutations in their emergence. Viruses constantly mutate, which can lead to new strains that are able to infect humans. This suggests option A might be relevant as well.\n\nExpert 3:\nStep 1: While both points are valid, we should also consider the environmental factors. Human encroachment into previously undisturbed habitats brings us into closer contact with animal reservoirs of these viruses. This aligns with option B, supporting the idea of disturbing forests where these viruses exist.\n\nExpert 1:\nStep 2: Building on the previous points, the disturbance of natural habitats seems to be the primary driver. This explains why these viruses ""continue to plague us"" as mentioned in the question. Human activities like deforestation and urbanization create opportunities for these viruses to spread from animals to humans.\n\nExpert 2:\nStep 2: I see the validity in the habitat disturbance argument. While mutations play a role in virus evolution, they don\'t fully explain the continued emergence of these specific viruses. I agree that option B seems to be the most comprehensive explanation for the ongoing issue.\n\nExpert 3:\nStep 2: I concur with the other experts.

RNA viruses are generally known to have higher mutation rates than DNA viruses due to the lack of proofreading mechanisms in RNA replication.\n\nExpert 2 (Epidemiologist):\nStep 1: When considering hypermutable viruses, we need to look at those that demonstrate rapid genetic changes. 'Emerging' viruses is a broad term and doesn't necessarily imply hypermutability, so we can likely rule out option B.\n\nExpert 3 (Molecular Biologist):\nStep 1: Hypermutability refers to an exceptionally high rate of genetic mutations. This characteristic is often associated with RNA viruses due to their error-prone replication process.\n\nExpert 1 (Virologist):\nStep 2: Among the options given, Influenza and HIV are both RNA viruses known for their high mutation rates. This supports option C, but we need to consider if this is the most comprehensive answer.\n\nExpert 2 (Epidemiologist):\nStep 2: Influenza and HIV are indeed known for their rapid mutations, but they are specific examples of a broader category. We should consider if there's a more general answer that encompasses these and other similar viruses.\n\nExpert 3 (Molecular Biologist):\nStep 2: RNA viruses as a group, which includes Influenza and HIV, are generally considered hypermutable due to their lack of error-correcting mechanisms during replication.
