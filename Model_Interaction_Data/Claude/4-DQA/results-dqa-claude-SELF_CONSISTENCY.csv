[TextBlock(text='Let\'s analyze this sentence step by step:\n\n1. The sentence: ""The secretary corrected the developer because he better understood the problem.""\n\n2.

In this sentence, ""he"" could grammatically refer to either the secretary or the developer.\n\n5. If ""he"" refers to the secretary, it would mean the secretary understood the problem better and therefore corrected the developer.\n\n6. If ""he"" refers to the developer, it would mean the developer understood the problem better, which makes the act of the secretary correcting the developer seem odd or contradictory.\n\n7. Logically, it might make more sense for ""he"" to refer to the secretary, but grammatically, it could refer to either.\n\n8. Because the pronoun could refer to either the secretary or the developer, and the context doesn\'t provide a clear indication of which is correct, the reference is ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the antecedent of ""he"" in this sentence is ambiguous.\n\nFinal Answer = ((C))', type='text')]
