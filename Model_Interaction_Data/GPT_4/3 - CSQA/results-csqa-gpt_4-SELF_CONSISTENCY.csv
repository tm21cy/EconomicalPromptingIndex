Moreover, some people who are extremely depressed might intentionally or unintentionally overdose on medication, either prescription or illegal drugs, as a method of self-harm or suicide. Whereas sadness is a big part of depression, it is not a direct cause of death. Murder refers to an act committed by another person to intentionally kill someone, and it is not directly linked to a person's mental state or feeling of depression. Cyanide is a toxic chemical that could lead to death if ingested, inhaled or come into contact with skin, but its relevance to depression is more of a method of suicide if one chooses to consume it and does not represent the principle cause of death when one is very depressed.\n\nTherefore, the possible answers that may lead to someone's death when they are very depressed are suicide and overdosing.\n\nFinal Answer = (A).

However, if we were to choose only one, we would have to keep the essence of learning in mind. Learning consists of gaining knowledge and skills. The key to gaining knowledge and skills is through studying, but you also need thought to apply what you've learnt in different scenarios. \n\nTherefore, the two main contenders remaining are (C) study and (E) thought. \n\nYou may have the patience to learn, the exposure to resources, but without actually taking the initiative to study, whether by reading, watching informational videos or by practicing your skills, learning will not take place. Also, after studying, if you do not think and analyze the information and how it could be applied, true learning does not take place. \n\nBoth are of equal prominence in the process of learning.

Self-learning often involves a lot of trial and error, and if you're not patient, it's easy to become frustrated and give up. So, (B) is also needed. \n\nThirdly, study is arguably one of the most important aspects of self-learning. Through study, you absorb the material or information you are trying to learn. Hence, (C) is an integral part of self-learning.\n\nThe fourth choice, cooperation, might not seem necessary at first, since you're learning on your own. However, it could be argued that a certain level of cooperation is necessary between different aspects of your own mind (for instance, the imaginative and logical sides) for effective learning. So, we can consider (D) also.\n\nLastly, thought is definitely necessary for self-learning. Without the ability to think and process the information, you're not really learning. Thus, (E) is necessary as well.\n\nAll of the choices appear to be necessary elements for self-learning, to one degree or another.
