The sentence is: ""The patient was referred to the specialist because he had a rare skin condition.""

The pronoun in question is ""he"". To determine the antecedent of ""he"", we need to look at the context of the sentence.

The sentence starts by mentioning ""The patient"" and then says ""he had a rare skin condition"". The logical connection is that the patient is the one with the rare skin condition, as the sentence is explaining why the patient was referred to the specialist.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is ""The patient"".

The sentence is: ""The scientist collaborated with the artist, and he shared a story.""

The pronoun ""he"" is the one we need to find the antecedent for. 

In the sentence, there are two possible antecedents: ""the scientist"" and ""the artist"". 

In English grammar, when a pronoun is used in a sentence, it usually refers to the noun or phrase that is closest to it. In this case, ""he"" is closer to ""the artist"" than ""the scientist"". 

So, the most likely antecedent of ""he"" is ""the artist"".

The options are:
(A) The developer uses big words
(B) The writer uses big words
(C) Ambiguous

Let's analyze:

* ""she"" is a feminine pronoun, and both ""developer"" and ""writer"" can be either masculine or feminine.
* The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is referring to the person who ""used big words"", which is the reason for the communication problem.
* The sentence doesn't provide any other context or clues to disambiguate the pronoun.

Based on this analysis, I would argue that the pronoun ""she"" is ambiguous, as it could potentially refer to either the developer or the writer.

The sentence is: ""Bailey planned to meet the director at their office""

The pronoun is ""their"", and we need to determine what it refers to.

In this sentence, ""their"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the office belongs to someone. The two possible antecedents are ""Bailey"" and ""the director"".

There is no clear indication in the sentence that suggests the office belongs to one or the other. The word ""their"" is a singular pronoun, which is used to refer to a singular noun, but in modern English, it is also used as a gender-neutral pronoun to refer to a person of unknown or unspecified gender.

Given the lack of clear context, we cannot definitively say that the pronoun ""their"" refers to either ""Bailey"" or ""the director"". Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is ambiguous.

There are two female nouns in the sentence: ""developer"" and ""designer"". 

The sentence structure suggests that ""she"" is a subject, and it is more likely that ""she"" refers to the person who is doing the liking (the subject of the verb ""liked"").

In this case, the sentence is structured to suggest that ""she"" is the developer, implying that the developer liked the design.

However, it is not impossible to interpret ""she"" as the designer, especially in informal writing or speech.

However, this is not a hard and fast rule, and the sentence could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. For example, if we know that the sentence is talking about the scientist's actions, then ""he"" could refer to ""the scientist"".

In standard English grammar, when a pronoun is used in a sentence, it typically refers to the nearest preceding noun that agrees with it in number (singular or plural). In this case, the nearest preceding noun is ""the cashier"", which is a singular noun like ""he"".

If we examine the sentence structure, we see that ""him"" is the object of the verb ""gave"", which is performed by the subject ""the carpenter"".

Logically, it makes more sense for ""the carpenter"" to give something to ""the designer"" rather than to himself.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""him"" is likely ""the designer"".

The pronoun is ""they"". To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun that ""they"" refers to.

The sentence is: ""The secretary corrected the developer because they better understood the problem.""

The options are:
(A) The secretary understood the problem
(B) The developer understood the problem
(C) Ambiguous

Let's analyze the sentence:

* ""The secretary"" is the subject performing the action of correcting.
* ""the developer"" is the object being corrected.
* ""because they better understood the problem"" is the reason for the correction.

Logically, the sentence implies that the person who understood the problem better is the one who corrected the other. Since the secretary is the one doing the correcting, it's likely that the secretary is the one who understood the problem better.

However, the use of the singular pronoun ""they"" (instead of ""he"" or ""she"") makes the sentence ambiguous. It's not entirely clear whether ""they"" refers to the secretary or the developer.

Given the ambiguity, the correct answer is:

The sentence is: ""The undergraduate applied to work with the scientist because he needed a lab assistant.""

The question is: Who is ""he""?

From the sentence, we can see that ""he"" is the subject of the clause ""he needed a lab assistant"".

Now, we need to determine who needed a lab assistant. Is it the undergraduate or the scientist?

The sentence structure suggests that the reason the undergraduate applied to work with the scientist is because someone (he) needed a lab assistant.

It is more likely that the scientist needed a lab assistant, as the undergraduate is applying to work with the scientist, implying that the scientist is in a position to receive assistance.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the scientist.

The sentence is: ""The driver yelled at the tailor after he broke a window.""

The pronoun is ""he"".

The antecedent of ""he"" could be either ""the driver"" or ""the tailor"", as both are masculine nouns.

However, in terms of sentence structure and logic, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to ""the tailor"", because the sentence is describing the consequence of someone's action (breaking a window), and it's more natural to assume that the consequence (the yelling) is directed at the person who performed the action.

But, it's not entirely clear, and the sentence could be interpreted in both ways. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The antecedent of ""him"" is the noun that ""him"" refers to.

In this sentence, there are two nouns: ""the designer"" and ""the cook"".

Since ""him"" is a masculine pronoun, it is more likely to refer to a male person.

Both ""the designer"" and ""the cook"" could be male, so we need to consider the context and the syntax of the sentence.

The sentence structure suggests that the pronoun ""him"" is more closely related to the second noun ""the cook"" because it appears immediately after ""the cook"" in the sentence.

* ""his"" is a pronoun, and we need to determine its antecedent.
* ""secretary"" is a noun, likely referring to a person who works for someone.

The question is, whose secretary is being referred to? 

If ""his"" refers to ""my parent"", then the sentence means that the speaker's parent called their own secretary. This would imply that the parent has a secretary, which is possible.

On the other hand, if ""his"" refers to someone else, it's not clear who that person is. The sentence structure suggests that ""his"" might refer to a person mentioned earlier, but there is no other person mentioned.

The sentence structure suggests that the assistant is doing the asking, and ""they"" is the subject of the subordinate clause ""they could borrow some money"".

If ""they"" referred to the physician, it would be strange for the assistant to ask the physician if the physician could borrow money from the assistant. It's more likely that the assistant is asking the physician if the assistant can borrow money.

The pronoun in question is ""he"". To find its antecedent, we need to look for a noun that agrees with ""he"" in number (singular) and gender (masculine).

The two possible antecedents are ""the carpenter"" and ""the onlooker"". Both are singular and masculine, so we need to consider the context and the sentence structure.

The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is more closely related to ""the carpenter"" because it appears in the same clause: ""The carpenter told the onlooker that he had been working on the house for three weeks."" It's more natural to assume that the subject ""the carpenter"" is the one performing the action described by ""he"".

However, it's not impossible to interpret ""he"" as referring to ""the onlooker"". This would require a slightly different reading of the sentence, but it's still a plausible interpretation.

Given this analysis, I would conclude that the antecedent of ""he"" is ambiguous.

The sentence structure is: ""The sheriff protected the writer because they [do something]"".

The word ""because"" introduces a reason or explanation for the action of protecting the writer. The phrase ""they uphold the peace"" is providing that reason.

In this context, it's more likely that ""they"" refers to the person being protected, i.e., ""the writer"", rather than the person doing the protecting, i.e., ""the sheriff"".

The sentence starts with ""Alex tells us"", which introduces two entities: Alex and us (the speaker and possibly others).

Then, it says ""that he could not meet"". The pronoun ""he"" refers back to one of these entities.

In this case, it's more logical to assume that ""he"" refers to Alex, because Alex is the one telling us something, and the sentence is describing Alex's situation (his inability to meet).

Both ""The developer"" and ""The secretary"" could potentially be the antecedent of ""she"", as both are nouns that refer to people.

However, grammatically, it is more likely that ""she"" refers to ""The secretary"" because ""The secretary"" is the closest noun to ""she"" in the sentence, and ""The secretary"" is a more likely subject to ""understood the problem"" than ""The developer"" (who is doing the correcting).

The sentence is: ""The assistant asked the physician if she needs any help.""

The pronoun is ""she"".

To determine the antecedent of ""she"", we need to look at the context of the sentence. The sentence has two nouns: ""assistant"" and ""physician"".

In this sentence, ""she"" is more likely to refer to ""the physician"" because the assistant is doing the asking, and it's typical for someone to ask if the person they're asking (the physician) needs help.

However, it's not impossible to interpret ""she"" as referring to ""the assistant"", especially if we read the sentence quickly.

Given the ambiguity, I would conclude that:

In the sentence, ""The surgeon warned the patient that they needed to get more rest."", we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"".

The pronoun ""they"" refers to the subject of the clause ""they needed to get more rest"". 

The clause ""they needed to get more rest"" is part of the warning given by the surgeon to the patient. 

In this context, it's more likely that the surgeon is warning the patient to get more rest, rather than the surgeon themselves needing more rest.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is the patient.

The sentence is: ""The surgeon warned the nurse that they needed more time to prepare.""

The pronoun is ""they"".

The question is: Who does ""they"" refer to?

Well, the sentence structure suggests that ""they"" is the subject of the clause ""that they needed more time to prepare"". This clause is part of the warning given by the surgeon to the nurse.

In this context, it's more likely that ""they"" refers to the team or the people involved in the preparation, rather than a specific individual (the surgeon or the nurse).

However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact antecedent of ""they"". It could be the surgeon and their team, or it could be a more general ""they"" referring to the people involved in the preparation.

The worker is the one doing the telling, and the pedestrian is the one being told. It's more likely that the worker is telling the pedestrian to avoid the closed portion of the street, rather than the worker being told to avoid it.

The pronoun in question is ""he"". We need to determine what ""he"" refers to.

The sentence is: ""The mechanic greets the receptionist because he was in a good mood.""

The two options for the antecedent of ""he"" are ""the mechanic"" and ""the receptionist"".

In English, when a pronoun is used, it usually refers to the noun that is closest to it in the sentence. In this case, ""he"" is closer to ""the receptionist"" than ""the mechanic"".

However, the sentence structure and the context of the situation also play a role in determining the antecedent. It's more likely that the reason for the mechanic's action (greeting the receptionist) is because the mechanic himself was in a good mood, rather than the receptionist's mood influencing the mechanic's action.

So, considering both the proximity and the context, it's not entirely clear what ""he"" refers to. Therefore, the correct answer is:

We need to determine what ""their"" refers to. Let's look at the sentence structure:

* ""Sam"" is the subject, performing the action of going to an office.
* ""the producers"" is the object of the prepositional phrase ""with the producers"", indicating who Sam met with.
* ""their office"" is the object of the verb ""goes to"", indicating the location Sam is going to.

The sentence mentions two nouns: ""assistant"" and ""physician"". The pronoun ""he"" could potentially refer to either of them.

However, based on the sentence structure and the logic of the situation, it's more likely that ""he"" refers to ""the physician"". The assistant is asking the physician if they need help, so it makes sense that the pronoun ""he"" would refer to the physician.

But, I must admit that it's not 100% clear-cut, and some people might interpret it differently. Therefore, I'd say the pronoun ""he"" is slightly ambiguous in this sentence.

In this context, it is more likely that ""him"" refers to the housekeeper, as the sentence structure suggests that the chief is the one performing the action of giving tips.

In terms of logical meaning, it is more likely that Alex sent the letter, as the sentence is saying that Alex didn't know Taylor until some action was taken, and that action is sending a letter. It's more probable that Alex took that action to initiate contact with Taylor.

The pronoun is ""she"", and we need to determine what it refers to.

The sentence is: ""The mechanic disliked the cashier because she is arrogant.""

The pronoun ""she"" is a singular feminine pronoun, which means it can only refer to a singular feminine noun.

In the sentence, we have two nouns: ""mechanic"" (singular, but masculine) and ""cashier"" (singular, feminine).

Given the context and the fact that ""she"" is a singular feminine pronoun, it is more likely that ""she"" refers to ""cashier"", which is the only singular feminine noun in the sentence.

The pronoun in question is ""he"". To determine its antecedent, we need to look at the sentence structure and the nouns that precede the pronoun.

The sentence is: ""The developer met with the secretary because he made a mistake.""

The nouns that precede the pronoun ""he"" are ""the developer"" and ""the secretary"".

In this sentence, the pronoun ""he"" is more likely to refer to ""the developer"" because it is the subject of the sentence and is performing the action of meeting with the secretary. The phrase ""because he made a mistake"" is providing a reason for the meeting, and it is more logical that the developer made a mistake that needs to be discussed with the secretary.

However, it's worth noting that the sentence is not entirely clear, and one could argue that ""he"" could also refer to ""the secretary"", meaning that the secretary made the mistake and that's why the developer met with them.

The sentence structure and wording suggest that the car is being repaired by the mechanic, and the customer is being informed about its status. This implies that the car belongs to the customer.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is ""the customer"".

Now, ""her"" is a feminine pronoun, and ""chef"" can be either male or female. On the other hand, ""reporter"" can also be either male or female, but the pronoun ""her"" suggests that the reporter is female.

The pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to a person who asked for a tool. There are two people mentioned in the sentence: the laborer and the secretary.

Now, let's look at the options:

(A) The laborer asked for a tool - This option suggests that the pronoun ""they"" refers to the laborer. However, the sentence structure implies that the laborer is doing the handing, and it's unlikely that the laborer would hand something to the secretary because the laborer asked for it.

(B) The secretary asked for a tool - This option suggests that the pronoun ""they"" refers to the secretary. This makes more sense in the context of the sentence, as the secretary is the one receiving the hammer, and it's plausible that the secretary asked for a tool.

Now, we need to determine who ""he"" refers to. The two options are ""the physician"" and ""the baker"".

The pronoun in question is ""he"". We need to determine what ""he"" refers to in the sentence.

The sentence structure is: ""The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor, otherwise he would have to mop it all over again.""

The ""otherwise"" clause is describing a consequence of the child stepping on the wet floor. The consequence is that someone would have to mop the floor again.

The two possible antecedents for ""he"" are ""the janitor"" and ""the child"".

If ""he"" refers to ""the janitor"", it makes sense that the janitor would have to mop the floor again.

If ""he"" refers to ""the child"", it's less likely that the child would have to mop the floor again (although it's not impossible).

Although it's not entirely clear, it's more likely that the nurse is the one who is busy because the sentence starts by mentioning the nurse's action (staying away).

In general, when a pronoun appears in a clause, it is more likely to refer to the noun that is closer to it. In this sentence, ""she"" is closer to ""the patient"" than to ""the surgeon"".

Additionally, the context of the sentence suggests that the surgeon is giving a warning or advice to the patient, so it is more logical for ""she"" to refer to the patient, who is the recipient of the warning.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ""the patient"".

The sentence has two noun phrases: ""The reporter"" and ""the chef"". The pronoun ""his"" is a singular pronoun, so it cannot refer to both ""The reporter"" and ""the chef"" together.

In English, when a singular pronoun like ""his"" is used, it typically refers to the noun phrase that comes before it. In this sentence, ""his"" comes after ""The reporter and the chef"", so we might expect ""his"" to refer to the last noun phrase mentioned, which is ""the chef"".

However, this is not a hard and fast rule, and the sentence is not entirely clear. It's possible that ""his"" could refer to ""The reporter"", especially if the sentence is part of a larger context where the reporter's preferences are being discussed.

Consider the meaning of the sentence: ""The developer was unable to communicate with the writer...""

If the developer is unable to communicate with the writer, it's likely because the writer is focusing on something else (in this case, code). This would imply that ""they"" refers to the writer.

The two options for the antecedent of ""she"" are ""the homeowner"" and ""the inspector"".

However, considering the context of the sentence, it is more likely that ""she"" refers to ""the homeowner"" because the sentence is describing the homeowner's action of asking the inspector about the house.

The pronoun in question is ""she"". To determine its antecedent, we need to look at the sentence structure and the nouns that come before it.

The sentence is: ""The secretary corrected the developer because she better understood the problem.""

The two nouns that come before the pronoun ""she"" are ""secretary"" and ""developer"". The pronoun ""she"" is a singular feminine pronoun, which suggests that it is referring to one of these two nouns.

In this sentence, it is more likely that ""she"" refers to ""the secretary"", as the sentence is saying that the secretary corrected the developer because the secretary (she) better understood the problem.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is ""the secretary"".

The sentence is: ""The paralegal forgot to file paperwork for the client so he was fired.""

The two possible antecedents for ""he"" are ""the paralegal"" and ""the client"".

Logically, it makes more sense for ""he"" to refer to ""the paralegal"", because the sentence is saying that the paralegal forgot to do something, so it's likely that the paralegal is the one who was fired.

However, the sentence structure is a bit ambiguous, and some people might interpret ""he"" as referring to ""the client"". But this interpretation is less likely, because it doesn't make sense for the client to be fired for the paralegal's mistake.

Option (A) suggests that the CEO needed a car. However, this doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence, because the CEO is the one buying the car, not receiving it.

Option (B) suggests that the accountant needed a car. This makes more sense, because it would explain why the CEO bought the accountant a car.

The sentence is: ""The librarian helped the CEO to find the book because she asked.""

The pronoun in question is ""she"".

To determine the antecedent of ""she"", we need to look at the sentence structure and the context.

The sentence has two potential antecedents: ""The librarian"" and ""the CEO"".

The phrase ""because she asked"" is a dependent clause that provides a reason for the action described in the main clause. In this case, the action is ""The librarian helped the CEO to find the book"".

Given the context, it's more likely that the CEO is the one who asked for help, and therefore ""she"" refers to the CEO.

However, it's not impossible to interpret ""she"" as referring to the librarian, especially since ""she"" is closer to ""The librarian"" in the sentence.

The sentence is: ""Bailey plans to meet the director at their office"".

The nouns in the sentence are ""Bailey"" and ""the director"". The pronoun ""their"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the office belongs to one of these two nouns.

Now, if the sentence meant that the office belongs to Bailey, it would be more natural to say ""Bailey plans to meet the director at Bailey's office"" or ""Bailey plans to meet the director at my office"" (if Bailey is the speaker). However, the use of ""their"" suggests that the office belongs to someone else, rather than Bailey.

Furthermore, the sentence implies that the meeting is taking place at the office of the person being met, which is the director.

Therefore, the most likely antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is ""the director"".

The pronoun ""he"" refers to a male person who asked. We have two male individuals mentioned: the librarian and the CEO.

The phrase ""because he asked"" provides the reason for the librarian's action (helping the CEO to find the book). It is more logical that the CEO asked for help, which prompted the librarian to assist him.

2. ""gave him a blueprint"" - The pronoun ""him"" appears here, and we need to determine what it refers to.

Based on the sentence structure and the typical way we use pronouns in English, it's more likely that ""him"" refers to the carpenter.

The pronoun in question is ""their"". We need to determine what ""their"" refers to.

""My parent"" is the subject of the sentence, and ""their"" is a possessive pronoun indicating that the secretary belongs to someone.

Since ""my parent"" is the only noun phrase in the sentence that could be associated with a secretary, it's likely that ""their"" refers to ""my parent"".

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is ""my parent"".

The sentence is: ""The cleaner called the guard and asked him to open the door.""

The pronoun in question is ""him"". To find the antecedent, we need to identify which noun ""him"" refers to.

The sentence has two nouns: ""the cleaner"" and ""the guard"". The verb ""called"" is performed by ""the cleaner"", and ""the guard"" is the recipient of the call. Then, someone (the pronoun ""him"") is asked to open the door.

Considering the sentence structure and the actions described, it is more logical to assume that ""him"" refers to ""the guard"", as the guard is the one being asked to perform the action (opening the door).

The sentence is: ""The visitor tells the teacher that she likes the cake.""

The pronoun is ""she"". To determine the antecedent of ""she"", we need to look at the possibilities:

* ""The visitor"" is a possible antecedent.
* ""The teacher"" is also a possible antecedent.

However, the sentence structure and the context suggest that ""she"" is more closely related to ""the visitor"" because ""the visitor"" is the one performing the action of telling, and it's more natural to assume that the visitor is the one who likes the cake.

But, we can't deny that there's some ambiguity here. If we didn't have any context, we couldn't be 100% sure who ""she"" refers to.

The sentence is: ""The developer met with the designer because his idea can be implemented.""

The pronoun in question is ""his"". We need to determine what ""his"" refers to.

The sentence mentions two people: ""the developer"" and ""the designer"". The pronoun ""his"" is a masculine singular pronoun, so it can refer to either of these two males.

The sentence structure suggests that ""his idea"" is the reason for the meeting, but it doesn't explicitly state whose idea it is.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either ""the developer"" or ""the designer"".

The sentence is: ""The CEO bought the accountant a car because they needed one.""

The CEO and the accountant are the two possible antecedents for ""they"". Let's consider each option:

(A) The CEO needed a car: This doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. The CEO is buying a car for someone else (the accountant), so it's unlikely that the CEO is the one in need of a car.

(B) The accountant needed a car: This is a more plausible option. The CEO is buying a car for the accountant, which suggests that the accountant is the one who needs a car.

However, it's worth noting that the pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous in this sentence. It's not entirely clear whether the CEO or the accountant is the intended antecedent. The sentence structure is ambiguous, and the meaning could be interpreted in different ways.

So, while option (B) is a more plausible interpretation, the correct answer is:

The sentence has two nouns that ""them"" could potentially refer to: ""secretary"" and ""analyst's office"" (which implies the analyst).

However, the sentence structure suggests that ""them"" is more likely to refer to the analyst, as the secretary is the one performing the action of helping. It's more natural to assume that the secretary is helping someone else, rather than helping themselves.

The sentence is: ""The surgeon warned the nurse that he needed more time to prepare.""

The pronoun in question is ""he"".

The sentence structure is as follows:
- ""The surgeon"" is the subject, performing the action of warning.
- ""the nurse"" is the indirect object, receiving the warning.
- The clause ""that he needed more time to prepare"" is the direct object, providing the content of the warning.

Now, we need to determine which noun ""he"" is more likely to refer to.

Since the surgeon is the one performing the warning, it is more logical that ""he"" refers to the surgeon, as it is uncommon for the nurse to warn themselves.

In the sentence, ""The manager asked the employee to not forget his car,"" the pronoun in question is ""his.""

To determine the antecedent of ""his,"" we need to consider the context and the relationship between the manager and the employee.

The manager is asking the employee to do something, which suggests that the action is related to the employee's responsibility or task. Additionally, the sentence implies that the employee is being asked to remember or take care of something belonging to someone.

Given this context, it is more likely that ""his"" refers to the employee's car, rather than the manager's car. If it were the manager's car, the sentence would be asking the employee to remember the manager's car, which seems less plausible.

To determine the antecedent of ""he"", we need to look at the context and the words surrounding the pronoun.

We have two nouns: ""the chief"" and ""the writer"". The pronoun ""he"" is more closely connected to ""the writer"" because it appears immediately after ""the writer"" in the sentence. This suggests that ""he"" refers to ""the writer"".

Additionally, the phrase ""because he wrote a good book"" provides a reason for the chief's encouragement. It makes more sense that the writer wrote a good book, which led to the chief's encouragement.

The pronoun ""she"" refers to a female person who sent the letter. We need to identify which female person is being referred to.

There are two female names mentioned in the sentence: Alex and Taylor. 

Since the sentence structure is ""Before she sent the letter..."", the pronoun ""she"" is more likely to refer to the person who sent the letter. 

Out of the two female names, Alex is the more likely candidate because the sentence states ""Alex did not know Taylor"", which implies Alex is the one performing the action.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is Alex.

The pronoun in question is ""they"". To find its antecedent, we need to look for a noun that ""they"" can logically refer to.

The sentence has two nouns: ""the driver"" and ""the tailor"". 

Now, let's analyze the sentence structure. The phrase ""after they broke a window"" is a dependent clause that describes an action that occurred before the main action of the sentence (the yelling). 

In this context, it's more natural to assume that the person who broke the window is the one who was yelled at. 

However, the pronoun ""they"" is plural, which makes it ambiguous. It could, in theory, refer to both the driver and the tailor, but this doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.

The pronoun in question is ""he"". To determine its antecedent, we need to identify the noun it refers to.

The sentence has two nouns: ""secretary"" and ""developer"". The pronoun ""he"" is used to describe someone who understands the problem better.

The phrase ""because he better understood the problem"" is a dependent clause that provides the reason for the action (correcting the developer). The clause implies that someone has a better understanding of the problem, which is the reason for the correction.

Given the context, it is more likely that ""he"" refers to the person who is being corrected, which is the developer. This makes sense because the secretary is correcting the developer, implying that the developer is the one who needs to understand the problem better.

So, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is the ""developer"".
