1. ""The scientist collaborated with the artist...""

Here, we have two noun phrases: ""the scientist"" and ""the artist"". These are the two potential antecedents for the pronoun ""he"".

2. ""...and he shared a story.""

Now we have the pronoun ""he"". We need to determine which of the two noun phrases it refers to.

In English, when we have a sentence with two clauses connected by ""and"", the pronoun in the second clause tends to refer to the subject of the first clause. This is because the subject of the first clause is often the topic or focus of the sentence. In this case, the subject of the first clause is ""the scientist"".

However, it's not impossible for the pronoun ""he"" to refer to ""the artist"". The sentence structure is fairly symmetric, and both noun phrases are equally prominent.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that:

 Sentence: Bailey planned to meet the director at their office

* ""Bailey"" is a noun and refers to a person.
* ""planned"" is a verb and is the action Bailey is taking.
* ""to meet"" is an infinitive phrase indicating the purpose of Bailey's planning.
* ""the director"" is a noun phrase and refers to another person.
* ""at their office"" is a prepositional phrase indicating the location of the meeting.

The pronoun ""their"" is the key to this question. To determine the antecedent of ""their"", we need to look at the nouns that come before it: ""Bailey"" and ""the director"".

* ""Their"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the office belongs to someone.
* ""Bailey"" and ""the director"" are both possible antecedents, but the sentence structure doesn't make it clear which one is intended.

Here, we need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

The pronoun ""he"" is a singular, masculine pronoun, which means it must refer to a singular, masculine noun in the sentence.

The sentence has two singular, masculine nouns: ""developer"" and ""writer"".

The clause ""because he focuses on code"" is a subordinate clause that provides the reason for the developer's inability to communicate with the writer.

The pronoun ""he"" is closest to ""writer"" in the sentence, but it's still possible for ""he"" to refer to ""developer"" since it's a singular, masculine noun.

(B) The writer focuses on code: This is also a possible interpretation, as ""he"" could refer to ""writer"".

(C) Ambiguous: This option suggests that the pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous and could refer to either ""developer"" or ""writer"".

Step 2: Identify the potential antecedents
The potential antecedents for the pronoun ""he"" are ""The patient"" and ""the specialist"".

Step 3: Analyze the sentence structure
The sentence is saying that the patient was referred to the specialist because of some characteristic or reason. The word ""because"" introduces a dependent clause that explains why the patient was referred.

Step 4: Determine the antecedent of the pronoun
The dependent clause ""because he is an expert on rare skin conditions"" is describing the reason for the referral. It is more likely that the specialist is the expert on rare skin conditions, since the patient is being referred to the specialist for their expertise.

Sentence: The technician told the customer that she had completed the repair.

The pronoun in question is ""she"".

To determine the antecedent of ""she"", we need to look at the sentence structure and the nouns that come before it.

The sentence has two nouns: ""technician"" and ""customer"". The pronoun ""she"" is a singular feminine pronoun, which means it can only refer to one of these two nouns.

Now, let's analyze the sentence:

* ""The technician"" is a singular noun, and it is a feminine noun (although it can be masculine or feminine depending on the context, here it seems more likely to be feminine).
* ""The customer"" is also a singular noun, but it is unspecified in terms of gender.

Given that ""she"" is a feminine pronoun, it is more likely to refer to ""the technician"", which is also a feminine noun.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"" is likely to be ""the technician"".

The word ""their"" is possessive, indicating that it belongs to someone or something. The two potential antecedents in the sentence are ""supervisor"" and ""employee"".

**Step 3:** Analyze the context and relationships between the words.
The sentence states that the supervisor gave feedback to the employee, suggesting that the feedback is about the employee's performance. The word ""stellar"" means excellent or outstanding, which further supports the idea that the feedback is about the employee's good performance.

 Sentence: The salesperson tried to fool the writer and sold them some garbage.

We need to identify the antecedent of the pronoun ""them"".

The sentence has two noun phrases:

1. ""The salesperson"" (subject)
2. ""the writer"" (object)

The pronoun ""them"" is a object pronoun, which means it refers to a noun that is not the subject of the sentence.

Now, let's look at the options:

(A) Sold the salesperson some garbage: This option suggests that the pronoun ""them"" refers to ""the salesperson"", which is unlikely because the salesperson is the one doing the selling, not the one being sold to.

(B) Sold the writer some garbage: This option suggests that the pronoun ""them"" refers to ""the writer"", which makes more sense because the sentence implies that the salesperson is trying to fool the writer.

(C) Ambiguous: This option suggests that the pronoun ""them"" is ambiguous and could refer to either ""the salesperson"" or ""the writer"".

* ""The driver yelled at the tailor"": This phrase sets the scene and introduces two characters: the driver and the tailor.
* ""after he broke a window"": This clause describes the reason for the driver's yelling. The pronoun ""he"" refers to one of the two characters mentioned earlier.

Now, let's determine the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

* ""he"" could refer to ""the driver"", implying that the driver broke the window and then yelled at the tailor. This would mean that the driver's action (breaking the window) triggered their own yelling.
* Alternatively, ""he"" could refer to ""the tailor"", implying that the tailor broke the window and the driver yelled at them in response.

Since both interpretations are possible, the pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous in this sentence.

The sentence is: ""The visitor told the teacher that he liked the cake.""

The pronoun in question is ""he"". We need to determine what ""he"" refers to.

Part 1: Identify the nouns in the sentence.

* The visitor (a noun)
* the teacher (a noun)

These are the two potential antecedents for the pronoun ""he"".

Part 2: Analyze the sentence structure.

The sentence is in the form of ""X told Y that Z"", where X is the visitor, Y is the teacher, and Z is the clause ""he liked the cake"".

Part 3: Determine the most likely antecedent.

In this sentence structure, it is more common for the pronoun ""he"" to refer to the subject of the main clause, which is ""The visitor"". This is because the visitor is the one doing the telling, and it is more natural for the pronoun to refer back to the subject.

However, it is also possible to interpret ""he"" as referring to ""the teacher"", especially in spoken language where the context and intonation can clarify the meaning. But in written language, without additional context, the ambiguity remains.

The pronoun ""his"" is a possessive adjective, indicating that the secretary belongs to someone. The sentence has two nouns that could be the antecedent of ""his"": ""My parent"" and ""secretary"".

If ""his"" refers to ""My parent"", then the sentence means that my parent has a secretary, and my parent called that secretary.

Now, let's focus on the pronoun ""she"" and determine its antecedent.

The sentence structure and word choice suggest that ""she"" is more likely to refer to the janitor, because:

* The janitor is the one who would be responsible for mopping the floor.
* The verb ""mop"" is more closely associated with the janitor's role than the child's.
* The sentence implies that the janitor is the one who would be negatively affected by the child's action (having to mop again).

**Step 2: Analyze the sentence**
The sentence is talking about the support needed to publish a story. The sentence mentions ""the writer"" and ""his friends"".

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) The mechanic is standing in front of the door: This option suggests that the pronoun ""she"" refers to the mechanic. However, the sentence clearly states that the mechanic is the one doing the greeting, whereas ""she"" is the one standing in front of the door. This option doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence.

(B) The receptionist is standing in front of the door: This option suggests that the pronoun ""she"" refers to the receptionist. This makes sense, as the sentence implies that the mechanic is greeting the receptionist because of her location.

The options are:

To identify the antecedent of ""she"", we need to look at the nouns in the sentence that could potentially be referred to by ""she"".

The nouns are:

The word ""that"" introduces a subordinate clause, which provides more information about what the hygienist told the patient.

The pronoun ""she"" is the subject of the subordinate clause.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) The hygienist should floss: This would mean that the hygienist is the one being referred to by the pronoun ""she"", which doesn't make sense in context. The hygienist is the one giving the advice, not receiving it.

(B) The patient should floss: This is a more plausible option. The hygienist is telling the patient something, and the pronoun ""she"" could be referring to the patient.

The sentence has two nouns that could potentially be the antecedent of ""he"": ""the mechanic"" and ""the receptionist"".

The sentence structure suggests that ""he"" is referring to the person who was in a good mood, and this good mood is the reason for the greeting.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) The mechanic was in a good mood
This option suggests that the mechanic is the one who was in a good mood, which makes sense in the context of the sentence. It's possible that the mechanic is the one who is feeling friendly and decides to greet the receptionist.

The sentence is: ""The construction worker called the editor and told him the whole story.""

The pronoun in question is ""him"".

To identify the antecedent of ""him"", we need to look at the noun phrases that come before ""him"".

There are two noun phrases: ""The construction worker"" and ""the editor"".

The verb ""called"" is related to ""The construction worker"", which is the subject of the sentence. The object of the verb ""called"" is ""the editor"".

Now, the verb ""told"" is related to ""him"". The question is, who is ""him""?

Since ""him"" is a masculine pronoun, it can only refer to one of the two masculine nouns: ""construction worker"" or ""editor"".

The sentence structure suggests that ""him"" is the object of the verb ""told"", which is more closely related to the verb ""called"" and its object ""the editor"".

Therefore, the most likely antecedent of ""him"" is ""the editor"".

 Sentence: The developer met with the secretary because they made a mistake.

Step 1: Identify the pronoun in question
The pronoun is ""they"".

Step 2: Determine the antecedent of the pronoun
The antecedent of ""they"" is not explicitly stated, but we can examine the sentence structure and context to make an educated guess.

The sentence has two nouns: ""the developer"" and ""the secretary"". The pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to one of these nouns, but it's not clear which one.

Step 3: Analyze the sentence structure and context
The sentence structure is ambiguous, as ""they"" could refer to either ""the developer"" or ""the secretary"". There is no clear grammatical or contextual cue to disambiguate the sentence.

The sentence is: ""The educator was meeting with a student to discuss their grading policy.""

The pronoun in question is ""their"".

To determine the antecedent of ""their"", let's look at the sentence structure and the noun phrases involved.

We have two noun phrases: ""The educator"" and ""a student"". The pronoun ""their"" is singular, so it must refer to one of these two noun phrases.

The sentence implies that the educator is meeting with the student to discuss a grading policy. The question is, whose grading policy is being discussed?

Since ""their"" is closer to ""student"" than ""educator"", it's possible to interpret ""their"" as referring to the student. This would mean that the student has a grading policy that's being discussed.

On the other hand, it's also possible to interpret ""their"" as referring to the educator, especially since the educator is the one meeting with the student. This would mean that the educator's grading policy is being discussed.

Given the ambiguity of the sentence, we can't definitively say which noun phrase is the antecedent of ""their"".

The sentence is: ""After meeting with the producers, Sam goes to her office.""

The pronoun in question is ""her"".

To determine the antecedent of ""her"", we need to look at the surrounding words and phrases.

The sentence mentions ""the producers"" and ""Sam"". The pronoun ""her"" is a feminine singular pronoun, which suggests that it refers to a female entity.

In this case, the only female entity mentioned is ""Sam"", which is a common female name. Therefore, it is likely that ""her"" refers to Sam.

However, it's possible to argue that ""her"" could also refer to one of the producers, if we assume that one of the producers is a female. But without further context, this interpretation is less likely.

So, based on the sentence alone, the most probable antecedent of ""her"" is Sam.

The sentence is: ""The patient disclosed to the counselor that they had a history of substance abuse.""

The pronoun in question is ""they.""

To determine the antecedent of ""they,"" let's look at the sentence structure:

* ""The patient"" is the subject of the sentence, performing the action of disclosing.
* ""to the counselor"" is a prepositional phrase indicating the indirect object (the recipient of the disclosure).
* ""that they had a history of substance abuse"" is a dependent clause, describing what was disclosed.

Now, let's examine the options:

(A) The patient had a history: This is a possible antecedent, as ""they"" could refer back to ""the patient,"" suggesting that the patient is the one with a history of substance abuse.

(B) The counselor had a history: This is less likely, as the sentence structure suggests that the counselor is the recipient of the disclosure, not the one with the history of substance abuse.

Considering the sentence structure and the likely meaning, I conclude that:

* ""The secretary came to the analyst's office...""
	+ Here, we have two nouns: ""secretary"" and ""analyst's office"". The possessive form ""analyst's"" implies that the office belongs to the analyst.
* ""...and helped her to book a flight.""
	+ The pronoun ""her"" appears, and we need to determine its antecedent (the thing it refers to).

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) Helped the secretary book a flight
	+ This option suggests that ""her"" refers to the secretary. But wait, the sentence structure implies that the secretary is the one performing the action of helping, so it's unlikely that the secretary is also the one being helped.
(B) Helped the analyst book a flight
	+ This option suggests that ""her"" refers to the analyst. This makes more sense, as the secretary is coming to the analyst's office, and it's reasonable that the analyst is the one being helped.
(C) Ambiguous
	+ This option suggests that the pronoun ""her"" is ambiguous and could refer to either the secretary or the analyst. While it's true that the sentence structure doesn't explicitly clarify the antecedent, the context and sentence flow suggest that option (B) is a more likely interpretation.

The pronoun ""her"" is a feminine singular pronoun. The only feminine noun in the sentence is ""secretary"", which is a common noun that can be either male or female. Since ""her"" is a feminine pronoun, it is more likely to refer to the secretary.

Step 3: Examine the sentence structure and possible antecedents. The sentence mentions two individuals: ""the developer"" and ""the writer"".

Step 4: Analyze the sentence meaning and the usage of ""he"". The phrase ""because he used big words"" is explaining why the developer was unable to communicate with the writer. This implies that the person using big words is the reason for the communication breakdown.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

(A) The developer uses big words: This option is possible, but it would imply that the developer was unable to communicate with the writer because of the developer's own behavior, which seems less likely.

(B) The writer uses big words: This option is more plausible, as it suggests that the writer's use of big words caused the communication breakdown with the developer.

The sentence is: ""The carpenter told the onlooker that she had been working on the house for three weeks.""

To determine the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"", we need to look at the surrounding context.

First, we have ""The carpenter"" as the subject of the sentence. Then, we have ""told the onlooker"" which introduces a new noun phrase. Finally, we have the clause ""that she had been working on the house for three weeks"".

Now, let's analyze the possible antecedents of ""she"":

* ""The carpenter"" is a possible antecedent, as it is a noun phrase that agrees with the pronoun ""she"" in number (both are singular) and is close to the pronoun in the sentence.
* ""The onlooker"" is also a possible antecedent, but it is less likely, as the pronoun ""she"" would need to refer to a female onlooker, and the sentence doesn't provide any information about the onlooker's gender.

The sentence is: ""The secretary corrected the developer because she better understood the problem.""

We're looking for the antecedent of the pronoun ""she"", which is the noun that ""she"" refers to.

Let's examine the sentence:

* ""The secretary"" is a noun phrase that refers to a person.
* ""corrected"" is a verb that indicates an action performed by the secretary.
* ""the developer"" is a noun phrase that refers to another person.
* ""because"" is a conjunction that introduces a reason or explanation.
* ""she"" is the pronoun we're trying to find the antecedent for.
* ""better understood the problem"" is a clause that describes the reason why the secretary corrected the developer.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) The secretary understood the problem: This option suggests that ""she"" refers to ""the secretary"". This is a possible interpretation, as the sentence structure implies that the secretary is the one who corrected the developer.

(B) The developer understood the problem: This option suggests that ""she"" refers to ""the developer"". This is also a possible interpretation, but it's less likely because the sentence structure implies that the secretary is the one who has a better understanding of the problem.

The pronoun in question is ""them"".

The sentence has two nouns that could potentially be the antecedent of ""them"":

1. The construction worker
2. The editor

Now, let's analyze the sentence structure and the pronoun ""them"":

* The sentence starts with ""The construction worker"", which is the subject of the sentence.
* The verb ""called"" has ""The construction worker"" as its subject and ""the editor"" as its object.
* The verb ""told"" is a continuation of the sentence, and its subject is still ""The construction worker"" (since there's no new subject introduced).
* The pronoun ""them"" is the object of the verb ""told"".

Considering the sentence structure and the pronoun ""them"", it's more likely that ""them"" refers to ""the editor"", since the editor is the object of the previous verb ""called"" and is the more recent and closest noun to the pronoun ""them"".

Step 3: Analyze the options
Option (A) suggests that ""they"" refers to the cousin's boss, which is correct because ""his"" refers to the cousin's boss.
Option (B) suggests that ""they"" refers to the boss's boss, which is incorrect because the pronoun ""his"" refers to the cousin's boss, not the boss's boss.

""The CEO bought the accountant a car because he needed one.""

Here, we're asked to find the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"".

Let's identify the nouns in the sentence:

* CEO

* car

The pronoun ""he"" is a singular pronoun, so it must refer to one of the singular nouns in the sentence.

The sentence structure is: ""The CEO bought the accountant a car because [reason]"".

The reason for buying the car is given as ""he needed one"". This implies that the person who needed a car is the one who received the car as a gift.

Now, let's analyze the options:

(A) The CEO needed a car: This is possible, but it doesn't fit well with the sentence structure. If the CEO needed a car, it's unlikely they would buy one for the accountant.

(B) The accountant needed a car: This is more plausible. The CEO bought the accountant a car, and the reason given is that ""he"" (the accountant) needed one.

(C) Ambiguous: While the sentence structure could be interpreted in different ways, the context suggests that ""he"" is more likely to refer to the accountant.

The antecedent of ""he"" is the noun that ""he"" refers to. In this sentence, there are two nouns that could potentially be the antecedent: ""the librarian"" and ""the CEO"".

**Step 3: Analyze the sentence structure**
The sentence structure is a bit tricky. The subordinate clause ""because he asked"" is providing a reason for the main clause ""The librarian helped the CEO to find the book"". The pronoun ""he"" is in the subordinate clause.

**Step 4: Determine the most likely antecedent**
In English, when a pronoun appears in a subordinate clause, it often refers back to the subject of the main clause. In this case, the subject of the main clause is ""The librarian"".

Option (B) suggests that ""her"" refers to the chef's culinary training. This is more plausible because ""chef"" is a profession that could be held by a female person, making it more likely that ""her"" refers to the chef.

Option (C) suggests that the pronoun ""her"" is ambiguous, and it's unclear which noun it refers to.

Now, let's analyze the sentence structure and the context of the sentence.

The sentence starts by introducing the patient, and then explains why the patient was referred to the specialist. The phrase ""because she had a rare skin condition"" is a dependent clause that provides the reason for the referral.

Given the sentence structure and context, it is more likely that ""she"" refers to the patient, rather than the specialist. This is because the sentence is explaining the reason why the patient was referred to the specialist, and the condition is the reason for the referral.

**Step 1: Identify the pronoun**
The pronoun in question is ""his"".

**Step 2: Identify the potential antecedents**
We have two potential antecedents: ""the developer"" and ""the designer"".

**Step 3: Analyze the sentence structure**
The sentence structure is: ""The developer met with the designer because [reason]"". The reason is ""his idea can be implemented"".

**Step 4: Determine the antecedent of ""his""**
The pronoun ""his"" is used to describe the idea. We need to decide whether it refers to the developer's idea or the designer's idea. The sentence structure suggests that the reason for the meeting is related to the idea, but it doesn't explicitly state whose idea it is.

**Conclusion**
The antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either ""the developer"" or ""the designer"".

The pronoun is ""they"".

**Step 2:** Look at the sentence structure and the nouns mentioned.
The sentence mentions two nouns: ""The CEO"" and ""the accountant"".

**Step 3:** Analyze the sentence meaning and determine the antecedent of the pronoun ""they"".
The sentence says ""The CEO bought the accountant a car because they needed one."" Here, ""they"" seems to be referring to the person who needed a car. The sentence implies that the CEO bought the car as a gift because someone needed a car. 

**Step 4:** Determine the most likely antecedent of ""they"".
Since the sentence structure implies that the car was bought as a gift, it's more likely that the accountant is the one who needed a car. The CEO is the one buying the car, so it's less likely that they needed a car.

End each answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = ((LETTER)) ex. Final Answer ((B)).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses on each side ex. ((A)).","Let's break down the sentence step by step.

The sentence is: ""The surgeon warned the nurse that he needed more time to prepare.""

To determine the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"", we need to look at the nouns in the sentence and their grammatical relationships.

* ""The surgeon"" is a noun phrase and the subject of the sentence.
* ""the nurse"" is another noun phrase and the object of the verb ""warned"".
* ""he"" is a pronoun and the subject of the dependent clause ""that he needed more time to prepare"".

In English, pronouns typically refer back to the closest noun phrase that agrees with them in number (singular or plural). In this case, ""he"" is a singular pronoun, and there are two singular noun phrases in the sentence: ""the surgeon"" and ""the nurse"".

Given the sentence structure, it is more likely that ""he"" refers to ""the surgeon"", because ""the surgeon"" is the subject of the main clause and ""he"" is the subject of the dependent clause. This would mean that the surgeon needs more time to prepare.

However, it's not impossible to interpret ""he"" as referring to ""the nurse"", especially in a context where the nurse is the one who needs more time to prepare. But this interpretation is less likely given the sentence structure.

To find the antecedent, we need to look for the noun that ""his"" refers to. In this sentence, we have two nouns: ""manager"" and ""employee"".

**Step 3: Analyze the sentence**
The sentence structure suggests that the manager is giving an instruction to the employee. The instruction is to not forget ""his"" car. 

**Step 4: Decide on the antecedent**
Based on the sentence structure and the instruction being given, it is more likely that ""his"" refers to the employee's car. The manager is telling the employee to not forget the employee's own car.

Sentence: My cousin called their boss for more information

The pronoun in question is ""their"". To determine its antecedent, let's analyze the sentence:

* ""My cousin"" is the subject of the sentence, referring to a specific person who is the speaker's cousin.
* ""called"" is the verb, indicating an action taken by the cousin.
* ""their boss"" is the object of the verb, indicating the person or entity that received the call.
* ""for more information"" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb ""called"", indicating the purpose of the call.

Now, let's examine the pronoun ""their"" in more detail:

* ""Their"" is a possessive pronoun, indicating that the boss belongs to someone.
* The most likely antecedent of ""their"" is ""my cousin"", as it is the closest noun phrase and the sentence implies that the cousin is calling their own boss.

Given this analysis, the most likely answer is:

 Sentence: The chief encouraged the writer because he wrote a good book.

1. Identify the pronoun: The pronoun is ""he"".

2. Determine the antecedent of the pronoun: The antecedent is the noun that the pronoun refers to. In this sentence, there are two potential antecedents: ""the chief"" and ""the writer"".

3. Analyze the sentence structure: The sentence uses the pronoun ""he"" to describe the person who wrote a good book. The phrase ""because he wrote a good book"" is a dependent clause that provides the reason for the chief's encouragement.

4. Determine the logical antecedent: Logically, the sentence implies that the writer wrote the good book, as the chief is encouraging the writer. However, the pronoun ""he"" is close to ""the chief"", which could also be interpreted as the antecedent.

5. Conclusion: Due to the proximity of the pronoun ""he"" to ""the chief"" and the ambiguity of the sentence structure, it's difficult to determine the antecedent with certainty.
