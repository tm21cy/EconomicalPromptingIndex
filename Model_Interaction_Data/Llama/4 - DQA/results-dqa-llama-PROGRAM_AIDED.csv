Explanation:
The program splits the sentence into words and finds the index of the pronoun 'he'. It then finds the indices of the nouns 'scientist' and 'artist' in the sentence. The closest noun to the pronoun is determined by finding the minimum absolute difference between the pronoun index and the noun indices. In this case, the closest noun is 'scientist', which is the one that appears before the pronoun. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun 'he' is 'The scientist'.

Explanation: In this sentence, the pronoun ""his"" is more likely to refer to the chef, as the chef's culinary training is more relevant to the context of the sentence. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"" is the chef.

Note that this program uses a simple heuristic to determine the antecedent, which is to choose the antecedent that is closest to the pronoun in terms of word distance.

In this sentence, the antecedent of the pronoun ""he"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either ""The driver"" or ""The tailor"". The sentence structure doesn't provide enough context to disambiguate the pronoun's reference.

Here's a Python program to solve this problem:

def determine_antecedent(sentence):

Output: `Final Answer = ((A))`

Explanation: The pronoun ""he"" refers to the visitor, which is the noun that appears before ""he"" in the sentence.

Here's a brief explanation of how the program works:

1. We split the sentence into individual words using the `split()` method.
2. We find the index of the pronoun ""he"" in the sentence.
3. We define a list of possible antecedents (`visitor` and `teacher`).
4. We iterate through the possible antecedents and check if the index of each antecedent is less than the index of the pronoun. If so, we return the corresponding answer (A or B).
5. If none of the antecedents are found, we return the answer C (ambiguous).

It then iterates through the words before the pronoun index, looking for nouns that are preceded by a determiner (""the"", ""a"", ""an"").

In this case, the pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous, as it could refer to either ""The scientist"" or ""the artist"".

Here's how the program works:

1. It identifies the pronoun ""they"" and the possible subjects ""The scientist"" and ""the artist"".
2. It splits the sentence into two parts using the "" and "" conjunction.
3. It checks if each subject is present in the first part of the sentence.
4. If it finds a matching subject, it returns the corresponding answer (A or B).
5. If it doesn't find a clear antecedent, it returns ""Ambiguous"" (C).

The program splits the sentence into words and finds the index of the pronoun ""she"". It then checks if either ""assistant"" or ""physician"" appears before the pronoun in the sentence.

Explanation:

In the sentence, the pronoun ""her"" refers to the closest preceding noun that is a female or can be referred to as ""her"". In this case, the closest preceding noun is ""carpenter"", which is a role that can be held by a female. Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" is ""carpenter"".",((B)),147,307

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun ""their"" is ""my parent"", which corresponds to option A.

2. It identifies the pronoun ""their"" and the nouns ""parent"" and ""secretary"" in the sentence.
3. If the sentence contains ""my"", it returns option A, indicating that the antecedent of ""their"" is ""my parent"".
4. If the sentence does not contain ""my"", it returns option C, indicating that the antecedent of ""their"" is ambiguous.

This program splits the sentence into words and checks for the presence of pronouns. If a pronoun is found, it checks the previous word to determine the antecedent. If the previous word is 'the', it considers the antecedent as ambiguous. If the previous word is not 'the', it returns the antecedent as the previous word.
