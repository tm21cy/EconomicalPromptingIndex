**Question/Query (does not include user bias/preference):**
Find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) is a field.

Using this unbiased text, we can provide an answer to the question:

To determine if Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) is a field, we need to check if the polynomial x^3 + cx^2 + 1 is irreducible over Z_3. 

Let's try each possible value of c:

* If c = 0, then x^3 + 1 = (x+1)(x^2 - x + 1), which is reducible.
* If c = 1, then x^3 + x^2 + 1 = (x+1)(x^2 + 1), which is reducible.
* If c = 2, then x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 = x^3 - x^2 + 1 (since 2 ≡ -1 (mod 3)), and this polynomial is irreducible over Z_3.

Therefore, the only value of c that makes Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) a field is c = 2.

**Question/Query (does not include user bias/preference):**
Determine the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+.

Now, using this unbiased text, we can provide an answer to the question:

Since the chemical shift differences are dominated by paramagnetic currents, we can assume a linear relationship between the electronic excitation energies and the chemical shifts. Let's calculate the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ relative to [Ru(CN)6]2-.

We know that the chemical shift of [Ru(H2O)6]2+ is 16,050 ppm relative to [Ru(CN)6]2-, and their electronic excitation energies are 18,900 and 40,000 cm-1, respectively. We can set up a proportion to relate the chemical shifts to the electronic excitation energies:

(16,050 ppm) / (18,900 cm-1) = x / (25,600 cm-1)

Solving for x, we get:

x ≈ 11,070 ppm

Therefore, the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ is approximately 11,070 ppm.

Raoult's law does not make any statements about the volume of the mixture, so statement II is not necessarily true.

Raoult's law assumes that the intermolecular interactions between molecules of different components are identical to those between molecules of the same component, so statement III is true.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope. . . .
Such are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.

**Unbiased text context (includes all content except user's bias):**
A bin has 5 green balls and $k$ purple balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer. A ball is drawn at random from the bin. If a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars, but if a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars. If the expected amount won for playing the game is 50 cents...

**Question/Query (does not include user bias/preference):**
...then what is $k$?

Using this unbiased text, we can answer the question:

Let's calculate the probability of drawing a green ball: $P(\text{green}) = \frac{5}{5+k}$. The probability of drawing a purple ball is: $P(\text{purple}) = \frac{k}{5+k}$. The expected amount won is the sum of the products of each outcome and its probability: $\frac{5}{5+k}(2) + \frac{k}{5+k}(-2) = 0.50$.

Simplifying the equation, we get: $\frac{10-2k}{5+k} = 0.50$. Solving for $k$, we get: $k = 3$.

The smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal and $n$ contains the digit 9.

**Question/Query (does not include user bias/preference):**
What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal and $n$ contains the digit 9?

Using this unbiased text, we can provide an answer to the question:

To find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the conditions, we need to find the smallest power of 2 or 5 (or a combination of both) that contains the digit 9. 

The smallest such number is 9 itself, but 1/9 is not a terminating decimal. The next smallest number is 18, but 1/18 is also not a terminating decimal. 

However, 1/90 = 0.01(1), which is a terminating decimal. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the conditions is 90, but this option is not among the choices. 

Among the given options, the smallest power of 2 that contains the digit 9 is 9 × 2^6 = 576, which is not among the options either.

Find the volume of the solid generated when...

Now, using this unbiased text, I'll provide an answer to the question:

To find the volume of the solid, we can use the method of disks. The region is bounded by the y-axis, y = e^x, and y = 2, and is rotated around the y-axis. This means we need to integrate the area of the circular cross-sections with respect to y.

The area of each cross-section is given by A(y) = π(x^2), where x is the value of the function y = e^x at a given y. To find x, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides: x = ln(y).

The limits of integration are from y = 1 (where the curve y = e^x intersects the y-axis) to y = 2. The volume is given by:

V = π∫[1,2] (ln(y))^2 dy

Evaluating this integral, we get:

V ≈ 0.592

Which of the following concerning uniform circular motion is true?

Using this unbiased text, I will provide an answer to the proposed question:

Uniform circular motion is a type of motion where an object moves in a circular path with a constant speed. In this context, centripetal force is the force that keeps the object moving in a circular path, while centrifugal force is the fictitious force that appears to act outward from the center of the circle. 

Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration that keeps the object moving in a circular path, and it is directed towards the center of the circle. The velocity of the object in uniform circular motion changes direction continuously, but its magnitude remains constant.

A satellite undergoing uniform circular motion is indeed falling towards the center of the Earth, but it is doing so in a circular path due to its high speed.

**Unbiased text context (includes all content except user's bias):**
Consider a hypothesis test with H0 : μ = 70 and Ha : μ < 70. 

**Question/Query (does not include user bias/preference):**
Which of the following choices of significance level and sample size results in the greatest power of the test when μ = 65?
A) α = 0.05, n = 15
B) α = 0.01, n = 15
C) α = 0.05, n = 30
D) α = 0.01, n = 30

Now, I'll provide an unbiased answer to the question:

To find the greatest power of the test, we need to calculate the power for each option and compare them. The power of a test depends on the significance level (α), sample size (n), and the true mean (μ). 

First, let's calculate the standardized test statistic (Z-score) for each option:

A) α = 0.05, n = 15: Z = (65 - 70) / (σ / √15) = -5 / (σ / √15)
B) α = 0.01, n = 15: Z = (65 - 70) / (σ / √15) = -5 / (σ / √15)
C) α = 0.05, n = 30: Z = (65 - 70) / (σ / √30) = -5 / (σ / √30)
D) α = 0.01, n = 30: Z = (65 - 70) / (σ / √30) = -5 / (σ / √30)

Next, we need to find the critical region and the rejection region for each option. Since Ha : μ < 70, the critical region is in the lower tail.

Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find the z-score corresponding to each significance level:

A) α = 0.05: Zcritical = -1.645
B) α = 0.01: Zcritical = -2.326
C) α = 0.05: Zcritical = -1.645
D) α = 0.01: Zcritical = -2.326

Now, we can calculate the power for each option:

A) Power = P(Z < -1.645) = 0.8997 (approx.)
B) Power = P(Z < -2.326) = 0.9903 (approx.)
C) Power = P(Z < -1.645) = 0.9638 (approx.)
D) Power = P(Z < -2.326) = 0.9985 (approx.)

Comparing the powers, we find that option D) α = 0.01, n = 30 has the greatest power.

Of all the band of adventurous cavaliers, whom Spain, in the sixteenth century, sent forth on the career of discovery and conquest, there was none more deeply filled with the spirit of romantic enterprise than Hernando Cortes. Dangers and difficulties, instead of deterring, seemed to have a charm in his eyes.… He conceived, at the first moment of his landing in Mexico, the design of its conquest. When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.… This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.… He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; … wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them. Yet this motley congregation was assembled in one camp, compelled to bend to the will of one man, to consort together in harmony, to breathe, as it were, one spirit, and to move on a common principle of action!

193,"Over the last several years, the economy of a state has substantially changed. The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill?
A) The commerce clause.
B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
C) The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
D) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.
