 The pronoun ""he"" in the sentence likely refers to the scientist. Therefore, the scientist needed a lab assistant. However, without additional context, it's not 100% certain, so there is a slight chance of ambiguity. In a strict grammatical sense, the sentence could be interpreted as the undergraduate needing an assistant.

Final Answer = ((B)).
 The pronoun ""he"" in this sentence is ambiguous because it could refer to either ""the undergraduate"" or ""the scientist"".

 Final Answer = ((A)). The pronoun 'they' in this context likely refers to the 'carpenter' who had been working on the house for three weeks.

In the given sentence, ""The mechanic called to inform the customer that their car would be ready in the morning,"" the pronoun ""their"" refers to the customer. This is because the mechanic is calling the customer about the car's status, which implies that it is the customer's car. If it were the mechanic's car, we would expect the sentence to be structured differently, such as ""The mechanic called to inform the customer that the mechanic's car would be ready in the morning.""
 The pronoun ""their"" in this sentence refers to the customer. Therefore, it was the customer's car that would be ready in the morning.
