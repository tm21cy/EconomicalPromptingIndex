Their behavior might create a sense of distance or unapproachability, which can affect their interactions with others. Let's analyze the options provided:

A) stress - This doesn't necessarily apply as the aloof and self-important individual may not experience stress when meeting people, but rather cause stress in others due to their demeanor.

B) nervousness - Similar to stress, there's no direct correlation between being aloof and self-important and feeling nervous when meeting people.

C) smile - This is not a likely outcome of an aloof and self-important person's interactions with others, as their demeanor typically does not convey warmth or openness.

D) being bored - This could potentially be an option, as their aloofness might indicate indifference towards forming new connections or relationships.

E) making new friends - This is unlikely, as their self-importance could hinder their ability to truly connect with people and form meaningful relationships.
