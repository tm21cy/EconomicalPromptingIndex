Which thing does the pronoun 'they' refer to in this sentence?

Answer:
To answer this question, let's look at the sentence in question: ""The carpenter told the onlooker that they had been working on the house for three weeks."" 

The possible options given are:
(A) The carpenter had been working on the house
(B) The onlooker had been working on the house

The pronoun 'they' in this sentence refers to the individual who had been working on the house, as indicated by the carpenter. By analyzing the sentence, we can deduce that neither the carpenter nor the onlooker was explicitly stated to be the one working on the house using the pronoun 'they'. Therefore, it is indeed ambiguous to which person the pronoun 'they' refers in this particular context.

Explanation: The sentence doesn't explicitly indicate who 'they' refers to. It could be the writer's friends, or it could be some other unspecified group, making the antecedent ambiguous.
