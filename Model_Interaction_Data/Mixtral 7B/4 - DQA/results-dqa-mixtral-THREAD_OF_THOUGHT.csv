Here is a breakdown of the sentence and how we can determine the antecedent of the pronoun ""his"":

1. The mechanic called...
	* This introduces us to the mechanic, who is the subject of the sentence.
2. ...to inform the customer...
	* This tells us that the mechanic is calling the customer, who is the recipient of the information.
3. ...that his car would be ready in the morning.
	* Here, we encounter the pronoun ""his."" But whose car is it?
	* Considering the context, the only reasonable antecedent is the customer.
	* The mechanic is not discussing his own car because the focus of the sentence is on the customer's car being repaired.

Therefore, the antecedent of ""his"" is the customer's car. However, since the sentence specifies which car is being referred to by using the phrase ""his car,"" it is still clear who the pronoun ""his"" is referring to. Thus, there is no ambiguity in this sentence.

2. Locate the potential antecedents in the sentence: the developer and the secretary
3. Analyze the context to determine which antecedent the pronoun refers to:
   a. If the developer understood the problem better, the secretary would not be the antecedent for the pronoun ""she.""
   b. However, the sentence specifies that the secretary better understood the problem.
4. The pronoun ""she"" unambiguously refers to the secretary in this context.

((A))."," In the sentence ""Bailey planned to meet the director at her office,"" the pronoun ""her"" refers to the director. This is because the meeting is taking place at the director's office, not Bailey's. Therefore, the director is the one being referred to with the pronoun ""her.""

Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two characters in this sentence: Bailey and the director.
2. The sentence states that Bailey planned to meet the director.
3. The sentence also states that the meeting would take place at ""her office.""
4. The pronoun ""her"" must refer to one of the two characters.
5. Since Bailey is already mentioned in the sentence as planning to meet the director, the pronoun ""her"" cannot refer to Bailey.
6. That leaves the director as the only possible antecedent for the pronoun ""her.""

Let's break it down further:

1. ""The patient was referred to the specialist"" - This means that the specialist is a separate individual from the patient.
2. ""because she is an expert on rare skin conditions"" - The word ""she"" is used to refer to the individual who has expertise in rare skin conditions.

Without more context, it is impossible to make a definitive determination. However, based on the information given, we can make an educated guess.

2. because she upholds the peace - This clause explains the reason for the sheriff's action. The subject of this clause is ""she,"" which is referring to someone who upholds the peace.

Let's break down the sentence step-by-step:

1. ""The janitor warned the child not to step on the wet floor..."" Here, it's clear that the janitor is giving a warning to the child. The antecedent of 'the janitor' is not explicitly stated before this phrase, but the context implies that the janitor is the person giving the warning.

2. ""...otherwise he would have to mop it all over again."" The pronoun 'he' is used here to refer to the person who would have to mop the floor. From the context, we know that the janitor is the one responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the floor, so it's more likely that he would be the one to mop it again.

3. If we consider the child as the antecedent of 'he', the sentence would imply that the child would have to mop the floor again, and it would be unclear why the child would mop the floor again.

Based on the grammar and wording of the sentence, it appears that the person who broke the window is the tailor. However, it's still possible that the writer made a mistake or intended for the driver to be the one who broke the window, in which case the sentence would be grammatically incorrect.

To help clarify the meaning of the sentence, let's identify the antecedent of the pronoun. The antecedent is the word or phrase that the pronoun refers to.

Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts:

* ""The driver yelled"" - This tells us that the driver was involved in some kind of action, but it doesn't specify what that action was.
* ""at the tailor"" - This tells us that the driver was directing their anger or frustration at the tailor.
* ""after she broke a window"" - This tells us that someone broke a window, and that this event happened before the driver yelled at the tailor.

Based on this analysis, it seems that the antecedent of the pronoun 'she' is the tailor, since the sentence implies that the tailor was the one who broke the window.

Let me break down the analysis step by step:

2. Identify the possible antecedents in the sentence: ""the construction worker"" and ""the editor""

4. Choose the correct antecedent: ""The editor"" is also a plural noun, and it is more likely the intended antecedent given that the sentence states that ""the construction worker called the editor and told them the whole story.""

The question is, which person does ""she"" refer to? Let's break down the sentence step by step.

This is because the phrase ""she had a rare skin condition"" provides information about the patient, not the specialist.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. The first part of the sentence, ""The patient was referred to the specialist,"" sets up a scenario where the patient needs help from a specialist.
2. The second part of the sentence, ""because she had a rare skin condition,"" explains the reason for the referral.
3. The pronoun ""she"" in this second part refers to a specific person, and the only female person previously mentioned in the sentence is ""the patient.""

The reason for this is that the patient is being referred to the specialist because of their expertise, so the specialist must be the expert being referred to.

Let's break down the sentence step by step to understand it better:

1. ""The patient was referred to the specialist"" - Here, it is clear that the subject of the sentence is ""the patient"" and the action is ""was referred."" The recipient of the action is ""the specialist.""
2. ""because they are an expert on rare skin conditions"" - In this portion, the conjunction ""because"" connects the previous clause to the reason for the action. The pronoun ""they"" refers to an expert on rare skin conditions, and it is implied that this expert is the person whom the patient was referred to for treatment.

Here, the pronoun ""her"" is referring to a female individual that the speaker is assuming the listener knows based on the context. However, without additional context, we can't determine for sure whether ""her"" refers to Bailey or the director.

Let's first identify the antecedents for the pronouns ""Bailey"" and ""her"" in this sentence.

The antecedent of ""Bailey"" is clearly ""Bailey"" itself, as it refers to the individual being mentioned in the sentence.

Now, let's analyze the antecedent for ""her"" by replacing the pronoun with the possible antecedents.

Bailey will plan to meet the director at Bailey's office.
Bailey will plan to meet the director at the director's office.

As you can see, both sentences convey different contexts. To determine which one is correct, we would need more context or information. Since we don't have it, it makes the antecedent of the pronoun ""her"" ambiguous.

Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts to understand it better:

1. ""The cleaner called the guard"" - In this part of the sentence, we are introduced to the two characters: the cleaner and the guard.
2. ""and asked him"" - In this part of the sentence, someone is asking someone else to do something.

* ""tells"" is the verb of the main clause.
* ""the teacher"" is the direct object of the main clause.
* ""that"" introduces the dependent clause.
* ""she"" is the subject of the dependent clause.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. ""The developer met with the designer"" - At this point, we have two characters, the developer and the designer.
2. ""because his idea can be implemented"" - Now, the sentence introduces an idea, but it doesn't clarify which character owns this idea—the developer or the designer. Therefore, the antecedent of ""his"" is ambiguous in this context.
