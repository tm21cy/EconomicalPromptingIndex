(A) ""They were the writer's friends"": This implies that the support came only from the writer's friends, not the writer herself. That's not consistent with the original sentence.
(B) ""They were the friends' friends"": This implies that the story could not be published without the support from each writer's other friends, which is not suggested in the original sentence.
