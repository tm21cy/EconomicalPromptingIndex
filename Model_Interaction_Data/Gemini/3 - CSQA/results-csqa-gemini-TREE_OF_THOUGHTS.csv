E) avoid 

End each answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = (LETTER) ex. Final Answer (B).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses ex. (A).","## Expert 1 - Step 1:

The sentence structure suggests we need a word that describes what the sanctions *did* to the school's efforts. This eliminates options C, D, and E as they describe nouns or actions not directly related to the efforts themselves. 

**Final Answer =  ()**

## Expert 2 - Step 1: 

""Punishing blow"" implies a negative impact on the school's efforts. This makes option B, ""enforce"", unlikely because enforcing efforts usually has a positive connotation.

The word ""ignore"" fits the context of the sentence and suggests the sanctions disregarded the school's efforts.

End each answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = (LETTER) ex. Final Answer (B).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses ex. (A).","## Expert 1 - Step 1

""Back entrance"" implies an opposite. Of the above choices, the opposite of ""back"" is usually ""front"".

## Expert 2 - Step 1

The question asks for an entrance that is NOT the back. This means any of the other options could be valid if they represent an entrance.

Hand throttles are common in vehicles like cars and airplanes, but foot-controlled steering eliminates airplanes.

Sean was lying and scared. This points to a fear of the consequences of his lie being revealed.

Lying out of fear suggests Sean is worried about the negative repercussions of telling the truth. This could be any of the options. 

Final Answer = (unsure)

## Expert 3 - Step 1: 

""Trouble"" and ""problems"" are too general. We need to focus on what specifically Sean fears about his lie being exposed.

I agree with Expert 3. Options D and E are too broad. However, my focus remains on the fear of exposure.

 Expert 1 makes a good point.  Options (D) and (E) are too general.  ""Hurt feelings"" seems unlikely in a situation involving a body and lying.

Reward money would be a concern if Sean was withholding information to get it, but the fear doesn't fit. He's scared because of the lie, not because he might miss out on a reward.

The phrase ""run errands"" is likely code for something secretive and possibly illegal given the context of a ""drug kingpin."" Of the above choices, the most fitting for illegal activities related to drug dealing is **taking money**.  

Final Answer = **(D)**

## Expert 2 - Step 1: 

""Run errands"" implies multiple tasks carried out for someone else. In the context of a drug kingpin, these tasks would likely involve his network of dealers. The most common task connecting a kingpin and his dealers is the collection of money. 

Final Answer = **(D)**

## Expert 3 - Step 1: 

The phrase ""run errands"" suggests a series of quick visits or stops. In the context of a drug operation, this could mean going to different locations. The most logical reason for a kingpin's man to visit multiple dealers is to collect the money they owe.

The sentence implies the body was doing something continuously throughout the day. Of the above options, ""working,"" ""moving,"" and ""exercising"" suggest continuous action. 

**Final Answer =  Not sure yet.** 

## Expert 2 - Step 1:

""Lay down"" is the opposite of what the sentence describes. The sentence focuses on the body's need for rest, implying prior activity.

**Final Answer = (B)**

## Expert 3 - Step 1: 

The phrase ""constantly"" suggests repetitive or ongoing action.  Options like ""working"", ""moving"", and ""exercising"" fit this description better than ""walk"".

**Final Answer = Not sure yet.**

## Expert 1 - Step 2: 

""Lay down"" being eliminated makes sense.  Between the remaining options, ""working"" has a broader meaning, encompassing both physical and mental exertion. This makes it a more suitable option than the more specific ""moving"" and ""exercising"".

## Expert 2 - Step 2:

(Expert 2 has already chosen an answer)

**Expert 3:**  The question implies a negative consequence of high demand for exotic snakes.  This could relate to the way they are transported or the places they end up.  ""Outdoors"" suggests potential for invasive species problems.

## Expert Round 3 and Beyond: 

From this point, the experts would continue to debate the merits of (D) pet shops and (E) outdoors.  

* **Arguments for (D):** It's the most direct and logical connection to the idea of ""carrying"" exotic snakes in the context of buying and selling.

**Expert 1:**  Driving that directly violates traffic laws is the most likely to lead to accidents.  **Final Answer = (D)**

**Expert 2:** While many types of driving can be factors, dangerous driving encompasses a wide range of risky behaviors that directly increase the likelihood of accidents. **Final Answer = (B)**

**Expert 3:** Accidents, by definition, result in some form of harm or damage. Therefore, deadly driving is the most closely linked to accidents. **Final Answer = (E)**


## Round 2

**Expert 1:**  While deadly driving certainly results in accidents, it's a consequence rather than a cause. Illegal driving remains the most direct link as it inherently increases risk. **Final Answer = (D)** 

**Expert 2:**  I agree that ""deadly"" is a result, not a cause. Dangerous driving encompasses a broader spectrum of behaviors that can *lead* to accidents, including illegal actions. **Final Answer = (B)**

**Expert 3:**  I realize my reasoning was flawed. Deadly driving is the outcome, not the cause. I cannot provide a better answer than my colleagues. **Expert 3 leaves.**

## Round 3

**Expert 1:**  I stand by my assessment. Illegal driving is the most direct and clear link to accidents as it inherently violates safety rules. **Final Answer = (D)**

**Expert 2:** While illegal driving is definitely a factor, ""dangerous"" encompasses a broader range of behaviors like speeding, tailgating, or driving while distracted, which may not always be illegal but significantly increase accident risk.  **Final Answer = (B)**

Expert 1 and 2 might continue debating the merits of their answers.  Expert 1 focuses on the direct violation of rules, making ""illegal driving"" a strong contender. Expert 2 argues that ""dangerous driving"" encompasses a wider spectrum of risky behaviors beyond just breaking the law.

**Expert 2:**  Fungi need organic matter to decompose. Not all options have readily available organic material. **Final Answer = (None yet)**

**Expert 3:** While sunlight is detrimental to some fungi, it's not a universal killer.  The question asks where it *won't* be disturbed, not necessarily where it *can't* grow. **Final Answer = (None yet)** 

**Expert 1:** Options like under rocks, fallen trees, and even toenails offer both darkness and organic material. Manhattan, while having dark places, might not always have readily available decomposing matter in all areas.  **Final Answer = (None yet)**

**Expert 2:** Grocery stores have food, but they are often too clean and dry for most fungi to thrive undisturbed.  **Final Answer = (None yet)**

**Expert 3:** Of the remaining options, a fallen tree provides the most consistent environment protected from sunlight. Under rocks can be disturbed, and toenails, while suitable, are a less common and smaller-scale environment.  **Final Answer = (E)**

**Expert 1:** I agree with Expert 3's reasoning. Fallen trees provide a stable, undisturbed environment with ample organic material.  **Final Answer = (E)**

**Expert 2:** A fallen tree is the most likely place a fungus could grow undisturbed by sunlight.  **Final Answer = (E)**

The question asks for a state. Of the above options, only Tennessee is a state south of Kentucky and north of Alabama.

E) paste 

End each answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = (LETTER) ex. Final Answer (B).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses ex. (A).","## Expert 1 - Step 1

The phrase ""figurative scars"" implies emotional or mental scars, not physical ones.  Therefore, I can eliminate options that relate to physical healing or joining. 

**Final Answer = ( )** 

## Expert 2 - Step 1

The sentence structure suggests we need a verb that describes what the scars will never do. This eliminates ""joining"" and ""paste"" as they are not typically used in this way.

**Final Answer = ( )**

## Expert 3 - Step 1

The word ""though"" at the beginning implies a contrast.  She made the cut (succeeded in something) but the scars remain. This suggests the scars represent a lasting negative impact.

The question implies Jamie's efforts to reduce her waist size were unsuccessful. So, the answer must reflect a continuation of her situation, not a solution. 

**Final Answer = (A)** 

## Expert 2 - Step 1

The question asks for a continuation of Jamie's state. Options like ""augment"" and ""make larger"" are direct actions and don't fit the flow of the sentence.

We need a word that describes what happens when someone fails repeatedly. Options like ""expand"" are too literal in the context of waist size.

""Gain weight"" doesn't necessarily mean her waist size will increase, other areas could be affected.

Alcohol lowers inhibitions and impairs judgment, making people more likely to act on impulses they might otherwise suppress.  Anger is an emotion that can lead to impulsive actions. **Final Answer = (A)**

## Expert 2 - Step 1

While all options are possible outcomes of excessive drinking, anger specifically suggests a heightened risk of aggression.  **Final Answer = (A)**

## Expert 3 - Step 1

Alcohol can lead to impaired coordination and balance. Anger itself doesn't directly cause this, but an angry drunk person might be more likely to stumble due to reckless behavior.  **Final Answer = (B)** 

## Expert 1 - Step 2 

While falling is possible, the direct link between anger and violence is stronger.  Alcohol-fueled anger often manifests as verbal or physical aggression. **Final Answer = (A)** 

## Expert 2 - Step 2

 I agree with Expert 1. The question specifically mentions anger, and violence is the most likely outcome in that context.  **Final Answer = (A)**

The sentence structure suggests we need a word that describes the decorations.  Options like ""little"" and ""small"" describe size, while ""terrible"" and ""horrible"" describe quality.

## Expert 2 - Step 1

The phrase ""scary decorations"" already sets the theme, so ""Halloween"" feels redundant. The sentence implies the decorations achieved their intended purpose (""He had done a great job""). This suggests we need a word reflecting positive execution.

The question implies a state that someone without immortality will eventually reach. Of the choices, 'dead' most directly reflects a final state. 

Final Answer = **(C)**

## Expert 2 - Step 1:

The phrase ""one day be"" suggests a future state or condition. Options like ""kick the bucket"" and ""can die"" describe actions or possibilities, not states of being.

## Expert 3 - Step 1:

""Lacking immortality"" directly translates to being mortal.

Expert 3 makes a good point. Being mortal is the defining state of someone who is not immortal.
