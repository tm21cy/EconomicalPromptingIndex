Now let's analyze the options:

* **(A) The patient had a skin condition:** This interpretation makes logical sense. Patients are typically referred to specialists for medical conditions. 
* **(B) The specialist had a skin condition:** While grammatically possible, it's less likely.  The sentence focuses on why the *patient* was referred, not the specialist's health.
* **(C) Ambiguous:**  While (A) is more likely, it's possible someone might interpret the sentence as (B).  Therefore, the sentence isn't perfectly clear.

## Determining the Antecedent:

While the sentence doesn't explicitly state whose performance is ""stellar,"" the context strongly suggests it's the **employee's performance**.  Here's why:

* **""The sheriff protected the writer...""** - This sets up two individuals we're discussing.
* **""...because they uphold the peace.""** -  The pronoun ""they"" is the key.  It refers back to someone who upholds the peace.

Now let's look at the options:

* **(A) The sheriff upholds the peace** - This fits the sentence's meaning. Sheriffs are law enforcement and upholding peace is logical. 
* **(B) The writer upholds the peace** - While possible, it's less common a role directly associated with writers.
* **(C) Ambiguous** - The sentence doesn't make it perfectly clear who ""they"" refers to.

**Analysis:**  While both sheriff and writer *could* uphold peace, the sentence's structure and common sense lean towards the sheriff. However, it's not impossible to interpret it the other way, making it slightly unclear.

**Sentence:** The reporter and the chef discussed his favorite dishes.

**Breakdown:**

1. **The Subjects:** ""The reporter and the chef"" - This tells us there are two people involved in the discussion. 
2. **The Verb:** ""discussed"" - This is the action they are performing together.
3. **The Object:** ""his favorite dishes"" - This is what they are discussing. The key here is the pronoun ""his.""

**The Problem:**  The pronoun ""his"" is meant to replace one of the subjects (either the reporter or the chef) to avoid repetition. However, the sentence doesn't make it clear *which* person ""his"" refers to.  

**Analyzing the Options:**

* **(A) They discussed the reporter's favorite dishes** -  This assumes ""his"" refers to the reporter. 
* **(B) They discussed the chef's favorite dishes** - This assumes ""his"" refers to the chef.
* **(C) Ambiguous** - This means we cannot definitively tell who ""his"" refers to based on the sentence alone.

**Analysis:**

The sentence structure makes it unclear who ""they"" refers to.  It could be that the CEO bought the accountant a car because the CEO needed a car.  It could also be that the CEO bought the accountant a car because the accountant needed a car. 

**Conclusion:**  The antecedent of the pronoun ""they"" is ambiguous.

* **""...came to the analyst's office...""** - This tells us the location and implies the analyst is a separate person from the secretary. 
* **""...and helped them to book a flight.""** - This is where the ambiguity lies. ""Them"" could refer to either the secretary or the analyst.

**Analysis:**

Since the sentence doesn't clearly indicate whether the flight is for the secretary or the analyst, the pronoun ""them"" is ambiguous.

**Analysis:**

* **""My cousin""** is the subject of the sentence, performing the action (calling).
* **""Their boss""** is the object of the verb ""called.""  The possessive pronoun ""their"" indicates the boss belongs to someone. 
* The sentence does not explicitly state who ""their"" refers to. It could be the cousin's boss or someone else's boss entirely.

**Options:**

* **(A) They were my cousin's boss** -  This is a possible interpretation, as ""their"" could logically refer to the cousin.
* **(B) They were the boss's boss** - This is also possible. The sentence doesn't exclude the possibility that ""they"" refers to someone else entirely.
