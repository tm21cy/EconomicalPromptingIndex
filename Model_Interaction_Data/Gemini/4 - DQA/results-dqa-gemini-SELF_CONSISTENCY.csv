* **The action:** ""asked... to open the door"" 

The sentence structure implies the cleaner is asking someone to open the door. Of the two people mentioned, only the guard has the authority to open the door. 

**Final Answer = ((B))** 

Let's think step by step:

1. **Identify the pronoun:** The pronoun in the sentence is ""them.""
2. **Look for possible antecedents:** The possible antecedents are ""the cleaner"" and ""the guard.""

The pronoun in question is ""he"".  We need to figure out who ""he"" refers to: the homeowner or the inspector.

The sentence structure makes it clear that the homeowner is the one who did the purchasing.  

* ""The homeowner asked the inspector..."" tells us about the two people involved.
* ""...if the house he had purchased...""  The pronoun ""he"" is connected to the act of purchasing.

* **The Pronoun:** The sentence doesn't actually contain any pronouns! Pronouns replace nouns.  The word ""his"" in this sentence is a possessive adjective, telling us whose boss it is.

* **The Meaning:** The sentence tells us that ""my cousin"" possesses a ""boss"".  We don't know anything about the boss's own superior. 

* **Conclusion:** Since there's no pronoun, we can't determine an antecedent.

**Final Answer = ((C))** 

Let's think step by step: 

The pronoun in question is ""his."" We need to figure out who ""his"" refers to.  

* The sentence tells us ""My cousin called his boss..."". 

The word ""his"" is indicating possession of the boss. The only person the sentence mentions as potentially possessing a boss is ""my cousin.""

* Therefore, ""his"" refers to ""my cousin.""

**Final Answer = ((A))** 

Let's think step by step:

The pronoun in question is ""his"".  We need to figure out who ""his"" refers to.  

* **""His""** is a possessive pronoun, indicating ownership.

* **The CEO needed a car:**  The CEO bought a car for the accountant because the CEO himself needed a car.
* **The accountant needed a car:** The CEO bought a car for the accountant because the accountant needed a car. 

The sentence doesn't give us enough information to definitively say which person ""he"" refers to.

**Final Answer = ((C))** 

Let's think step by step:

The sentence states ""The CEO bought the accountant a car because *he* needed one.""  The key to figuring out the antecedent of ""he"" is determining who needed the car. 

* **Did the CEO buy the accountant a car for the CEO's own use?**  That's unlikely. 
* **Is it more likely the CEO bought the car because the accountant needed it?** This makes more sense.

Therefore, ""he"" most likely refers to the accountant. 

**Final Answer = ((B))** 

Let's think step by step:

The sentence states that the CEO bought a car for the accountant *because* someone needed one.  The pronoun ""he"" is the key to figuring out who needed the car.

The sentence states ""The CEO bought the accountant a car because **they** needed one.""  The pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to someone needing a car. 

* **Option (A):**  The sentence doesn't explicitly say the CEO needed a car. It says the CEO bought a car for someone else.
* **Option (B):** The structure of the sentence implies the accountant is the one who needed the car and the CEO bought it for them. 
* **Option (C):** While it's *possible* the CEO also needed a car, the sentence's most logical interpretation points to the accountant as the one in need.

**Final Answer = ((B))** 

Let's think step by step:

The sentence states ""The CEO bought the accountant a car because **they** needed one.""  The pronoun ""they"" is used to refer to someone needing a car.  The sentence sets up two possibilities: the CEO or the accountant. 

Because the sentence doesn't definitively state who ""they"" refers to, it could be either the CEO or the accountant who needed the car.

Final Answer = ((C)) 

Let's think step by step:

The pronoun ""they"" is replacing a noun in the sentence. We need to figure out if ""they"" refers to the CEO or the accountant.

The sentence says the CEO bought the car *because* ""they"" needed one. This implies ""they"" is the one who needed the car. 

Since the sentence is about the accountant receiving a car, it's more logical that the accountant is the one who needed it.

The sentence suggests the car belongs to the employee, not the manager.

The sentence uses the pronoun ""his"" when referring to the car.  The possessive pronoun ""his"" is most likely referring back to either ""manager"" or ""employee"".  Since the sentence doesn't give us any more clues, it's impossible to know for sure who the car belongs to.
