* Pronoun: ""her""
* Possible antecedents: ""writer"" and ""salesperson""

* The sentence is ""The writer tried to fool the salesperson and told **her** a fake story.""
* The pronoun ""her"" is the object of the verb ""told.""
* The subject of the verb ""told"" is ""writer.""

* It is most likely that ""her"" refers to the salesperson, because:
    * The salesperson is the one being fooled, and therefore the one being told the story.
    * The writer is the one doing the telling.

* **(A) They were my parent's secretary:** This option is plausible because it establishes a connection between the parent and the secretary. The secretary would then be the antecedent of ""their.""
* **(B) They were the secretary's secretary:** This option is unlikely because it creates a confusing relationship between the secretary and another secretary.
* **(C) Ambiguous:** It is also possible that the sentence is ambiguous and the context does not provide enough information to determine the antecedent of ""their.""

The pronoun in the sentence is ""she.""

**Step 2: Determining possible antecedents**

""Subject (visitor) + transitive verb (tells) + recipient (teacher) + that clause + subject pronoun (she) + verb (likes) + object (cake).""

**Step 4: Applying knowledge of pronoun usage**

In a ""that"" clause, the subject pronoun typically refers to the same person or thing as the subject of the main clause.

**Step 5: Concluding the analysis**

Based on the sentence structure and pronoun usage, the most likely antecedent of ""she"" is ""the visitor.""

The antecedent of a pronoun is the noun or noun phrase that the pronoun refers to. In this context, the antecedent of ""his"" is not explicitly stated.

**Step 3: Analyze the options**

**(A) The developer's idea could be implemented**
The antecedent of ""his"" in this option is ""developer."" This makes sense because the sentence is about the developer meeting with the designer.

**(B) The designer's idea could be implemented**
The antecedent of ""his"" in this option is ""designer."" This does not make sense because the context does not mention the designer having an idea.

**(C) Ambiguous**
The pronoun ""his"" could refer to either the developer or the designer. Because the context does not provide enough information to determine the antecedent clearly, this option is ambiguous.
