E) sadness 

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = (LETTER) ex. Final Answer (B).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses ex. (A). Only do this once.","Expert 1: The wife likely felt a combination of emotions, including anguish and bitterness. When a marriage is failing, it's common for one or both spouses to feel like they're doing more than their fair share of the work. This can lead to feelings of frustration and resentment, which can manifest in various ways, such as through arguments or by withdrawing from the relationship. Next step: Anguish and bitterness could both be valid answers, but they are not specific emotions related to feeling as if they are doing all the work. I think tears or sadness would be more accurate.  

Expert 2: The wife likely felt overwhelmed and exhausted. When one person in a relationship feels like they are doing the majority of the work, it can take a significant toll on their emotional and physical well-being. The wife may have felt like she was constantly putting in more effort than her husband, and that her efforts were not being appreciated or reciprocated. Next step: Tears or sadness may be valid answers, but I think the wife would likely feel more than just tears or sadness. It can be overwhelming to feel like you're doing all the work in a relationship. I think harder is a good next step because it's more specific. 

Expert 3: The wife likely felt a sense of sadness and hopelessness. When a marriage is failing, it's common for one or both spouses to feel like they've lost the person they thought they knew. The wife may have felt like her husband was no longer interested in her or the marriage, and that the relationship was beyond repair. Next step: Tears or sadness is too broad of an answer. It's possible the wife felt tears or sadness, but I think it's more likely she felt anguish. Anguish more accurately describes the emotional turmoil and distress a wife would experience in this situation.

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = (LETTER) ex. Final Answer (B).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses ex. (A). Only do this once.","Expert 1: The question is asking for a place where a bald eagle is safe. A pine tree (A) might be a good place for a bald eagle to perch, but it is not necessarily safe. Open country (B) is not a good place for a bald eagle to be safe because it is exposed to predators. Option (C) says ""in washington"" but it does not specify any other characteristic. While Washington state is known for bald eagles, this option is also not descriptive enough to be correct. A wildlife refuge (D) is a place where bald eagles are protected and safe, so this is a good option. The sky (E) is a place where bald eagles can fly and hunt, but it is not necessarily safe because they can be shot or killed by other predators.

Expert 2: I agree with Expert 1 that a wildlife refuge (D) is a safe place for a bald eagle. Bald eagles are protected by law in the United States, and wildlife refuges are specifically designed to provide a safe habitat for wildlife.

Expert 3: I agree with Experts 1 and 2 that a wildlife refuge (D) is the best answer. Wildlife refuges are protected areas where bald eagles can nest, feed, and raise their young without being disturbed.

Thinking about the other options, Hobby shop and Toy store are places where you can get a kite and not necessarily where you lose it. This leaves us with the last straw and the end of the line. A straw doesn't sound like the best option. So I will choose the end of the line. 
Next>

**Expert 2:**  I agree with the reasoning of Expert 1. Going through the options, It is unlikely for the kite to be in a child's hand because it slipped out of Sally's fingers. So A is out. B is also out because it is talking about a straw, and that doesn't make sense. C and E are not related to what happened to the kite. That only leaves us with the last straw and the end of the line. The end of the line sounds more reasonable because it means the string ended and the kite was lost. 
Next> 

**Expert 3:**  I also agree with the reasoning of the other two experts. When I read the question, I thought that the last straw might be referencing an idiom. I thought it meant the last straw on the camel's back which means the last bit of weight put on something which then causes it to fail. So I was going to choose that. But then I realized that would not make sense because there is no mention of a camel in this question. So I will have to go with the end of the line.

A tabby cat is a domestic breed, so it is unlikely to be happiest in an alley or a barn.

**Expert 2:**

Tabby cats are known for being affectionate and playful, so they are likely to be happiest in a home where they can receive attention and stimulation.

**Expert 3:**

Tabby cats are natural hunters, so they may also enjoy spending time in a box where they can hide and play.

Next Step:

**Expert 1:**

Since a tabby cat is a domestic breed, it is most likely to be happiest in a home where it can receive food, water, shelter, and attention.

**Expert 2:**

Tabby cats are also known for being independent and curious, so they may also enjoy spending time in a yard or other outdoor space where they can explore.
