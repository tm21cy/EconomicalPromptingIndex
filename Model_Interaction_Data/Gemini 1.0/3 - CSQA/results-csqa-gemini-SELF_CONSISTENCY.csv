To make a big splash in a river with a rock, you should throw it from a higher elevation. This is because the higher the rock is thrown, the more potential energy it will have, and the more potential energy it has, the more kinetic energy it will have when it hits the water.

In an emergency situation, fire extinguishers are an essential safety device used to put out fires. Areas with potential fire hazards, such as those that store flammable liquids or gases, are likely to have fire extinguishers readily available. 
- Garages: Garages often house vehicles that run on gasoline, making them susceptible to fire risks. Fire extinguishers are commonly found in garages to address potential fires related to fuel, electrical systems, or other flammable materials.
- Hospitals: Hospitals handle various medical supplies, many of which are flammable or combustible. To ensure patient safety and prevent the spread of fires, hospitals typically have a significant number of fire extinguishers strategically placed throughout their facilities.
- Boats: Boats often use flammable fuels and electrical systems, increasing the risk of fire. Fire extinguishers are mandatory safety equipment on boats to quickly extinguish any fires that may erupt on board.
- Houses: Houses may contain various potential fire hazards, such as kitchens, fireplaces, and electrical appliances. Fire extinguishers are commonly found in houses to provide a quick response to small fires before they escalate.
- Doll houses: Doll houses are typically small-scale models of houses used for play and decoration. They are not likely to have fire extinguishers or experience real-world fire hazards.

The passage does not specify that the bassoon is being played in an unpleasing fashion, so we cannot eliminate any of the options based on this information. Therefore, we cannot answer this question.
Final Answer = N/A
A bassoon is a musical instrument in the woodwind family. It is a double-reed instrument, meaning that it produces sound by vibrating two reeds against each other. The bassoon has a low, rich sound that is often used in orchestral and band music.

Unpleasingly playing the bassoon could occur in any of the settings listed, as playing any instrument poorly can result in an unappealing sound. However, the bassoon's low, rich sound is particularly suited for orchestral and band music, making it more likely to be heard in those settings.

Final Answer = (E)
A bassoon is a double reed woodwind instrument. It is often used in orchestras, symphonies, and concert bands. It is known for its distinctive low-pitched sound. However, it is also possible to play the bassoon in an unpleasing fashion. This could happen if the player is not skilled or if the instrument is not in good condition. In addition, the bassoon can sound unpleasing if it is not played in the right context. For example, it may not sound good if it is played in a high school band, which is typically dominated by brass and percussion instruments.
