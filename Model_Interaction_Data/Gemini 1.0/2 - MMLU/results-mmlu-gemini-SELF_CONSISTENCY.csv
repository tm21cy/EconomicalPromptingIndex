C) True, False
D) False, True

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = (LETTER) ex. Final Answer (B).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses ex. (A). Only do this once.","Statement 1 is true since Z_2 is a field with only two elements, 0 and 1, and Q is the field of rational numbers. Statement 2 is also true, as the Nullstellensatz states that every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in an algebraic closure of that field. 

Final Answer = (A)
Statement 1 is true because Z_2 is a field with two elements, and Q is the field of rational numbers, which contains Z_2 as a subfield. Statement 2 is also true, as it is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
Final Answer = (A)
Fields are commutative rings with unity and invertibility(other than 0). Extension fields are larger fields which contain other fields. Z_2 is the field consisting of 0 and 1, with addition and multiplication modulo 2. Q is the field of rational numbers. It is a well-known fact that every finite field has prime-power order. Since Z_2 is a field with 2 elements, therefore it is a finite field of prime-power(2) order. Moreover, Q is an infinite field. Also every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field.

C) 1
D) 3

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = (LETTER) ex. Final Answer (B).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses ex. (A).

Therefore, Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) is a field for any c.
Final Answer = (A)
The polynomial x^3 + cx^2 + 1 is irreducible over Z_3 if and only if c = 0 or c = 2. Therefore, Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) is a field if and only if c = 0 or c = 2.

D) False, True

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = (LETTER) ex. Final Answer (B).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses ex. (A). Only do this once.","Statement 1 is true because every maximal ideal is a prime ideal. Statement 2 is true because if I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is an integral domain and a field.
Final Answer = (A)
Statement 1 is true because a maximal ideal is an ideal that is not properly contained in any other ideal other than the whole ring. A prime ideal is an ideal that contains no zero divisors, so a maximal ideal is a prime ideal. Statement 2 is also true because the quotient ring R/I is a field if and only if I is a maximal ideal. So both statements are true.

Final Answer = (A)
Statement 1 is true because every maximal ideal is the kernel of a ring homomorphism onto a field, and a ring homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel is a prime ideal.

Statement 2 is true because every maximal ideal of a commutative ring is a proper ideal, and a commutative ring with a proper ideal that is not a prime ideal is not a field.

The new ring inherits the commutative property from the original ring.

Statement 2 is also true because if 1 is in N, then for any element a in R, we have a = 1 * a, which is in N, so N contains all of R. Conversely, if N contains all of R, then 1 is in N.

Final Answer = (A)
**Statement 1** is true because every quotient ring of a commutative ring is constructed using equivalence classes, preserving the commutative property.

**Statement 2** is also true because if 1 is in N, then for any a in R, a = a * 1 is in N. Conversely, if N is all of R, then for any a in R, a = a * 1 is in N, implying that 1 is in N.

**Final Answer = A)**
**Statement 1:**
A quotient ring of a commutative ring is a ring constructed from the original ring by factoring out a particular ideal. Since an ideal is a subring, any quotient ring is also a ring. Furthermore, the operations of addition and multiplication in a quotient ring are inherited from the original ring, which is commutative. Therefore, every quotient ring of every commutative ring is again a commutative ring.

**Statement 2:**
An ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 is all of R if and only if 1 is in N.
If 1 is in N, then for any element a in R, we have a * 1 = a, which implies that a is in N. Therefore, N contains every element of R, which means that N is all of R.
Conversely, if N is all of R, then 1 is clearly in N.

$$\Delta \delta \propto J \propto E_e$$

Therefore,

$$\frac{\Delta \delta_{[Ru(H_2O)_6]^{2+}}}{\Delta \delta_{[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{2+}}}=\frac{E_{e,[Ru(H_2O)_6]^{2+}}}{E_{e,[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{2+}}$$

$$\Delta \delta_{[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{2+}}=\frac{E_{e,[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{2+}}}{E_{e,[Ru(H_2O)_6]^{2+}}}\times \Delta \delta_{[Ru(H_2O)_6]^{2+}}$$

$$\Delta \delta_{[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{2+}}=\frac{25,600\ cm^{-1}}{18,900\ cm^{-1}} \times 16,050 = 21,795$$

The chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ is 21,795 ppm relative to [Ru(CN)6]2- at 0 ppm.

Final Answer = (C)
The paramagnetic contribution to the chemical shift is proportional to the electronic excitation energy. Therefore, the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ relative to [Ru(CN)6]2- is:

16,050 ppm * (25,600 cm-1 / 18,900 cm-1) = 22,230 ppm

The chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ relative to [Ru(H2O)6]2+ is:

22,230 ppm - 16,050 ppm = 6180 ppm

Therefore, the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ is:

0 ppm + 6180 ppm = **6180 ppm**

**Final Answer = (C)**
Chemical shift (CS) is proportional to the diamagnetic component (DC) and paramagnetic component (PC):
CS = DC + PC

The DC is constant for a given nucleus and oxidation state. The PC is proportional to the excitation energy (EE):
PC = k * EE

So, the difference in CS between two complexes is proportional to the difference in their EEs:
CS1 - CS2 = k * (EE1 - EE2)

Using the given data, we can set up the following equation:
16,050 ppm - 0 ppm = k * (18,900 cm-1 - 40,000 cm-1)
k = -1.07 ppm / cm-1

Now, we can use this value of k to calculate the CS of [Ru(NH3)6]2+:
CS = 0 ppm + k * (40,000 cm-1 - 25,600 cm-1)
CS = 0 ppm - 1.07 ppm / cm-1 * 14,400 cm-1
CS = 15,408 ppm

Therefore, the chemical shift of [Ru(NH3)6]2+ is closest to 14,840 ppm.

The partial pressure of each component at equilibrium is proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid mixture. This is a direct consequence of Raoult's law.

II. The volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of the volumes of each component before mixing. This is not necessarily true for a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law. The volume of the mixture can be greater or less than the sum of the volumes of the pure components, depending on the intermolecular interactions between the two components.

III. Intermolecular interactions in the mixture are identical to intermolecular interactions in the pure components. This is not necessarily true for a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law. The intermolecular interactions between the two components can be different from the intermolecular interactions in the pure components, which can lead to deviations from Raoult's law.

Therefore, the only statement that must be true about a binary liquid mixture that obeys Raoult's law is I.

Final Answer = (A)
Raoult's law states that the partial pressure of a component in a liquid mixture is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the liquid mixture. Thus, statement I is true.  

Statement II is not necessarily true for mixtures that obey Raoult's law. 

Statement III is not necessarily true for mixtures that obey Raoult's law. 

Final Answer = (C)
Raoult's law states that the partial pressure of each component in a liquid mixture is proportional to its mole fraction in the mixture. This means that **I is true**.

Raoult's law does not make any predictions about the volume of the mixture. It is possible that the volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of the volumes of the pure components, but this is not a requirement. Therefore, **II is false**.

Raoult's law assumes that the intermolecular interactions in the mixture are identical to the intermolecular interactions in the pure components. This means that **III is true**.

Mergesort requires random access to the elements in the list to work efficiently. This means that we need to be able to access any element in the list in constant time.

A singly linked list does not allow for random access to elements, so it cannot be used for mergesort.

A doubly linked list allows for faster traversal of the list compared to a singly linked list, but it still does not allow for random access to elements. Therefore, it cannot be used for mergesort either.

An array allows for random access to elements, so it can be used for mergesort.

Therefore, the only data structure that will allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time is an array.

Final Answer = (B)
In mergesort, the time complexity of merging two sorted lists is O(n) and the time complexity of splitting the list is O(log n). If the data structure is a linked list, the time complexity of accessing any element is O(n). Therefore, the time complexity of mergesort on a linked list is O(n^2), which is not O(n log n).

**Step 2:** For x to be valid, it must satisfy both x > 0 and 10 - x > 0. Thus, 0 < x < 10.

**Step 3:** Given that A and B divide the segment randomly, x is uniformly distributed in the interval (0, 10).

**Step 4:** The probability that x satisfies the triangle inequality is the probability that x is less than 5.

**Step 5:** Since x is uniformly distributed in (0, 10), the probability that x is less than 5 is 5/10 = 0.5.

**Final Answer = (D)**

A and B are chosen simultaneously. In each case, there are restrictions on where the second point can be chosen to form a triangle. By considering all three cases, we find that the probability of forming a triangle is 10%. Final Answer = (B)
To form a triangle the sum of the length of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. 
Let's consider the smallest segment has length x. The two other segment must have length 5 - x and 5 + x. 
For these three segments to form a triangle, we must have 
5 - x + 5 + x > x, or 
10 > x
and 
5 - x + x > 5 + x, or 
5 > 0 which is always true

So we only need to check the first inequality 10 > x. Since x is the shortest segment, we require 
x < 10. 
Therefore the length of the smallest segment can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. There are 9 different possible lengths for the smallest segment. The total number of possible ways to choose 2 points to divide the segment into 3 smaller segments is

Solving the system of equations

$$\begin{cases} a+b+c=1 \\\ -a+c=2 \end{cases}$$

For doubly ionized lithium atom:

Rydberg constant = RLi++ = RH/Z^2 = RH/3^2 = RH/9

End your answer in this exact format: 'Final Answer = (LETTER) ex. Final Answer (B).'The letter you are selecting for your final must be surrounded by 2 parentheses ex. (A). Only do this once.","**Step 1: Use the Lorentz contraction formula to find the velocity**

The Lorentz contraction formula is given by:

```
L = L₀ / γ
```

where:

* L is the length measured by the moving observer
* L₀ is the length in the rest frame
* γ is the Lorentz factor

**Step 2: Solve for velocity**

We are given L = 0.80 m and L₀ = 1.00 m. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

```
0.80 m = 1.00 m / γ
```

Solving for γ, we get:

```
γ = 1.00 m / 0.80 m = 1.25
```

The Lorentz factor is related to the velocity by:

```
γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)
```

where:

* v is the velocity of the observer
* c is the speed of light

Solving for v, we get:

```
v = c√(1 - 1/γ²) = c√(1 - 1/1.25²) = 0.6c
```

**Final Answer = (B)**
The Lorentz contraction equation is:

$$L = L_0/\gamma$$

where:

* L is the length of the rod as measured by the moving observer
* L_0 is the length of the rod in its rest system
* $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor

We are given that L = 0.80 m and L_0 = 1.00 m. We can solve for $\gamma$ as follows:

$$\gamma = L_0/L = 1.00 m/0.80 m = 1.25$$

The Lorentz factor is also given by:

$$\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$$

where:

* v is the speed of the observer
* c is the speed of light

We can solve for v as follows:

$$1/\gamma = \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$$

$$1/1.25 = \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$$

$$0.80^2 = 1 - v^2/c^2$$

$$v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.80^2 = 0.36$$

$$v = 0.6c$$

Therefore, the observer must move parallel to the rod at a speed of 0.6c to measure its length to be 0.80 m.

Final Answer = (B)
**Step 1: Use the relativistic length contraction formula**

```
L' = L / γ
```

where:

* L' is the length measured by the moving observer
* L is the length in the rest system
* γ is the Lorentz factor

**Step 2: Solve for γ**

```
γ = L / L' = 1.00 m / 0.80 m = 1.25
```

**Step 3: Calculate the speed using the Lorentz factor**

```
γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)
1.25 = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)
```

Solving for v, we get:

```
v = 0.6c

Only do this once.","When white light enters a prism violet light is bent the most, then blue, green, yellow, orange and red in that order.
Final Answer = (B)
As white light passes through a prism, the different colors of light are refracted (bent) at different angles due to their varying wavelengths. Green light has a longer wavelength than blue light and a shorter wavelength than red light. According to the laws of refraction, light with a longer wavelength is bent less than light with a shorter wavelength. Therefore, green light is bent more than blue light but less than red light.
Final Answer = (C)
Green light has an intermediate wavelength between blue light and red light. According to the index of refraction, the bending of light is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Therefore, shorter wavelengths (blue light) are bent more than longer wavelengths (red light).

The N-H bonds within the NH3 molecules do not break apart, the overall temperature of the solution remains constant, and the amount of energy within the system increases.

Final Answer = (D)
During boiling, the intermolecular bonds between the NH3 molecules break apart, allowing them to escape into the gas phase. This corresponds to the breaking of hydrogen bonds.

B) NiSO3: Ni2+ is a small, doubly charged ion, while SO32- is a large, doubly charged ion. The larger size of SO32- is expected to make NiSO3 less soluble than NaBr.

C) CrCl3: Cr3+ is a small, triply charged ion, while Cl- is a small, singly charged ion. The high charge on Cr3+ is expected to make CrCl3 less soluble than NiSO3.

D) Mn(NO3)2: Mn2+ is a small, doubly charged ion, while NO3- is a small, singly charged ion. Therefore, Mn(NO3)2 is expected to be highly soluble in water, similar to NaBr.

Based on the above analysis, CrCl3 is expected to be the least soluble in water due to the high charge on the cation (Cr3+).

Final Answer = (C)
The solubility of ionic compounds in water depends on the charge and size of the ions involved. In general, ions with higher charges and smaller sizes are more soluble.

A) NaBr: Na+ is a small, singly charged ion, and Br- is also a small, singly charged ion. Therefore, NaBr is expected to be relatively soluble in water.

B) NiSO3: Ni2+ is a small, doubly charged ion, and SO32- is a large, doubly charged ion. The larger size of SO32- reduces the solubility of NiSO3 compared to NaBr.

C) CrCl3: Cr3+ is a small, triply charged ion, and Cl- is a small, singly charged ion. The high charge of Cr3+ makes CrCl3 less soluble than NaBr and NiSO3.

D) Mn(NO3)2: Mn2+ is a small, doubly charged ion, and NO3- is a small, singly charged ion. Therefore, Mn(NO3)2 is expected to be relatively soluble in water.

= 44.1 g/mol

2. Convert the given mass of propane (6.2 g) to moles:
Moles = Mass / Molar Mass
= 6.2 g / 44.1 g/mol
= 0.141 mol

Final Answer = (B)
First, we need to find the molar mass of propane (C3H8).

Molar mass of propane = (3 × 12 g/mol) + (8 × 1 g/mol) = 44 g/mol

Now, we can calculate the number of moles of propane in 6.2 g:

n = m/M = 6.2 g / 44 g/mol = 0.14 mol

Final Answer = (B)
1. Calculate the molar mass of propane (C3H8):
Molar mass of C = 12.01 g/mol
Molar mass of H = 1.01 g/mol

Molar mass of C3H8 = (3 x 12.01) + (8 x 1.01) = 44.09 g/mol

The multiplier effect is the process by which an increase in spending in one sector of an economy leads to increases in spending in other sectors, thus multiplying the initial increase in spending. This is because the additional income earned by the recipients of the initial spending is likely to be spent on other goods and services, leading to further increases in spending and income.

The multiplier effect is a key factor in economic growth, as it amplifies the impact of new spending on the overall economy. The multiplier effect is strongest in economies with a high level of economic interdependence, where businesses and households are heavily reliant on each other for goods and services.

The multiplier effect is not a fixed number, but rather varies depending on the characteristics of the economy in question. The size of the multiplier effect is determined by several factors, including the marginal propensity to consume, the level of imports, and the efficiency of the financial system.

The multiplier effect is a powerful tool that can be used to stimulate economic growth. By increasing spending in one sector of the economy, policymakers can create a ripple effect that leads to increases in spending and income throughout the economy.

Probability of drawing a green ball = 5/(5+k)

Probability of drawing a purple ball = k/(5+k)

Expected value = (probability of winning * amount won) + (probability of losing * amount lost)

0.5 = (5/(5+k)) * 2 + (k/(5+k)) * (-2)

0.5 = 10/(5+k) - 2k/(5+k)

0.5 = 10 - 2k / (5+k)

0.5 * (5+k) = 10 - 2k

2.5 + 0.5k = 10 - 2k

2.5k = 7.5

k = 3

Final Answer = (C)
The probability of drawing a green ball is $\frac{5}{5+k}$, and the probability of drawing a purple ball is $\frac{k}{5+k}$.

If a green ball is drawn, the player wins 2 dollars, and if a purple ball is drawn, the player loses 2 dollars.

Therefore, the expected amount won is:
$$\frac{5}{5+k} * 2 + \frac{k}{5+k} * (-2) = 50 \text{ cents}$$

$$\frac{10}{5+k} - \frac{2k}{5+k} = \frac{50}{100}$$

$$\frac{10 - 2k}{5+k} = \frac{1}{2}$$

$$10 - 2k = \frac{1}{2}(5+k)$$

$$10 - 2k = \frac{5}{2} + \frac{k}{2}$$

$$10 - \frac{5}{2} = 2k + \frac{k}{2}$$

$$\frac{15}{2} = \frac{5k}{2}$$

$$k = \frac{15}{2} * \frac{2}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3$$

Final Answer = (C)
**Step 1: Calculate the probability of drawing a green ball and the probability of drawing a purple ball.**

Probability of drawing a green ball = 5 / (5 + k)
Probability of drawing a purple ball = k / (5 + k)

**Step 2: Calculate the expected amount won for each outcome.**

Expected amount won for drawing a green ball = 2 dollars
Expected amount won for drawing a purple ball = -2 dollars

**Step 3: Calculate the overall expected amount won.**

Expected amount won = (Probability of drawing a green ball * Expected amount won for drawing a green ball) + (Probability of drawing a purple ball * Expected amount won for drawing a purple ball)

50 cents = (5 / (5 + k)) * 2 + (k / (5 + k)) * (-2)

**Step 4: Solve for k.**

Simplifying the equation:

50 cents = 10 / (5 + k) - 2k / (5 + k)
50 cents = (10 - 2k) / (5 + k)
(5 + k) * 50 cents = 10 - 2k
(5 + k) * 0.5 = 10 - 2k
5 + k = 10 - 2k

k = 5 / 3

Since f is concave up, T<=L. Therefore, R<=T<=M<=L.

Final Answer = (A)
Since the graph of f is increasing on [a, b], the values of f increase from left to right. This means that the left sum L will be the smallest, followed by the midpoint sum M, then the trapezoid sum T, and finally the right sum R, i.e., L < M < T < R.

Since the graph of f is concave up, the graph is shaped like a cup. The secant lines joining the endpoints of the subintervals will lie below the graph of f. Therefore, the trapezoid sum will underestimate the area under the curve, i.e., T < area under the curve.

Since M is the average of L and R, M will be closer to the area under the curve than either L or R. Therefore, M is the best approximation of the area under the curve.

As a result, we order the sums from smallest to largest as L < M < T < R. Hence, the correct answer is:

Final Answer = (A)
The graph of f is increasing, so the height of the rectangles used to compute the left sum L is less than or equal to the height of the rectangles used to compute the right sum R.

V = ∫[0, ln2] π(4 - e^(2x)) dx

V = π[4x - (1/2)e^(2x)] from 0 to ln2

Therefore, the volume is 2π(ln2 - 1).

Final Answer = (A)
With the washer method we can calculate this volume:

$V=\pi\int_a^b[R_2^2-R_1^2]dx$

Final Answer = (A)
In the long run, a monopoly firm is likely to produce at the output level where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR), as this is the point of profit maximization. At this output level, price (P) will be greater than average total cost (ATC), as the monopoly firm has market power and can set a price above the competitive level. Therefore, the most likely scenario is P > ATC > MR = MC.
Final Answer = (D)
In the long run, under a monopoly, profit-maximizing occurs when marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR). Since there are no close substitutes, the firm will set a price (P) above marginal cost, but equal to marginal revenue. Therefore, the firm can make abnormal profits as long as P exceeds average total cost (ATC). In the long run, these abnormal profits will attract new entrants until the market is competitive. Thus, the most likely scenario in the long run for a monopoly is MC = MR < P > ATC.

**Step 1: Determine the impact of the drought on pineapples.**

The drought will decrease the supply of pineapples, which will shift the supply curve to the left.

**Step 2: Determine the impact of the cancer discovery on pineapples.**

The discovery may assist in the avoidance of cancer, which can make pineapples more desirable. This will shift the demand curve to the right.

**Step 3: Combine the effects.**

The leftward shift in the supply curve will increase the equilibrium price and decrease the equilibrium quantity. However, the rightward shift in the demand curve will offset some of the impact of the supply shift.

**Final Answer = (B)**
The drought will lead to a decrease in the supply of pineapples, which will shift the supply curve to the left. The discovery of a potential cancer treatment will lead to an increase in the demand for pineapples, as people will be more likely to seek out preventive measures such as consuming fruits and vegetables. This will shift the demand curve to the right.

The combined effect of these two shifts will be an increase in the equilibrium price and quantity of pineapples. This is because the leftward shift of the supply curve will reduce the quantity supplied at any given price, while the rightward shift of the demand curve will increase the quantity demanded at any given price.

According to Charles' law, the volume of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature: V ∝ T. 
If the volume of the balloon is proportional to the cube of its circumference (V ∝ C^3), then: 
C^3 ∝ T. 

Therefore, a student plotting C^3 as a function of temperature T should expect to find a linear relationship between C^3 and T.
Final Answer = (A)
As the temperature increases, the volume of the balloon increases. The circumference of the balloon is related to the volume by the equation:
```
V = 4/3 * pi * r^3
```
Where:
* V is the volume of the balloon
* r is the radius of the balloon
* pi is a mathematical constant equal to approximately 3.14

The circumference of the balloon is related to the radius by the equation:
```
C = 2 * pi * r
```
Where:
* C is the circumference of the balloon

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
```
C = 2 * pi * (3V / 4pi)^(1/3)
```
Simplifying this equation, we get:
```
C^3 = (3V / 2)^(1/3)
```
Therefore, the circumference cubed is directly proportional to the volume of the balloon. As the volume of the balloon increases, the circumference cubed also increases.

The temperature of the balloon is directly proportional to the volume of the balloon. As the temperature of the balloon increases, the volume of the balloon also increases. Therefore, the circumference cubed is also directly proportional to the temperature of the balloon.

Final Answer = (D)
When exposed to a stimulus for a prolonged period, our senses adapt to it, making it seem less intense.

As the water temperature is the same, factors like sensory restriction, perceptual constancy, and relative clarity can be eliminated. The reason why the pool feels cool to a person who has been sunbathing and warm to a person who has been in the air conditioning is due to sensory adaptation.

The person who has been sunbathing has adapted to the higher temperature, so the pool water feels cooler in comparison. The person who has been in the air conditioning has adapted to the lower temperature, so the pool water feels warmer in comparison.

Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is true (μ = 70) but the test concludes that the null hypothesis is false.

The probability of a Type II error can be reduced by decreasing the significance level (α) and increasing the sample size (n).

Therefore, the choice that results in the greatest power is the one with the lowest significance level and the largest sample size.

Final Answer = (D)
The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. In this case, the alternative hypothesis is μ < 70, so the power of the test is the probability of rejecting H0 when μ = 65.

The power of a hypothesis test is affected by three factors: the significance level, the sample size, and the effect size. The effect size is the difference between the null hypothesis value and the alternative hypothesis value. In this case, the effect size is 70 - 65 = 5.

The significance level is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. A lower significance level means that we are less likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is true, which reduces the power of the test.

The sample size is the number of observations in the sample. A larger sample size means that we are more likely to detect a difference between the null hypothesis value and the alternative hypothesis value, which increases the power of the test.

In this case, we want to find the combination of significance level and sample size that results in the greatest power of the test when μ = 65. The effect size is 5, which is the same for all of the choices. Therefore, the choices that have a lower significance level and a larger sample size will have greater power.

**Choice A** has a significance level of 0.05 and a sample size of 15.
**Choice B** has a significance level of 0.01 and a sample size of 15.
**Choice C** has a significance level of 0.05 and a sample size of 30.
**Choice D** has a significance level of 0.01 and a sample size of 30.

Choice C has the lowest significance level and the largest sample size, so it will have the greatest power.

**Final Answer = (C)**
**Step 1:** Determine the effect size for each sample size and significance level.

Effect size = (μ0 - μ) / σ
σ is not given, so we assume it to be 5.

**Step 2:** Calculate the non-centrality parameter for each case.

Non-centrality parameter = sqrt(n) * |μ0 - μ| / σ

**Step 3:** Compare the non-centrality parameters to determine which case results in the greatest power.

**Case A:** α = 0.05, n = 15
Effect size = (70 - 65) / 5 = 1
Non-centrality parameter = sqrt(15) * 1 / 5 = 1.73

**Case B:** α = 0.01, n = 15
Effect size = (70 - 65) / 5 = 1
Non-centrality parameter = sqrt(15) * 1 / 5 = 1.73

**Case C:** α = 0.05, n = 30
Effect size = (70 - 65) / 5 = 1
Non-centrality parameter = sqrt(30) * 1 / 5 = 2.45

**Case D:** α = 0.01, n = 30

Of all the band of adventurous cavaliers, whom Spain, in the sixteenth century, sent forth on the career of discovery and conquest, there was none more deeply filled with the spirit of romantic enterprise than Hernando Cortes.

When he saw the strength of its civilization, he was not turned from his purpose.… This spirit of knight-errantry might lead us to undervalue his talents as a general, and to regard him merely in the light of a lucky adventurer. But this would be doing him injustice; for Cortes was certainly a great general, if that man be one, who performs great achievements with the resources which his own genius has created. There is probably no instance in history, where so vast an enterprise has been achieved by means apparently so inadequate.… He brought together the most miscellaneous collection of mercenaries who ever fought under one standard: adventurers from Cuba and the Isles, craving for gold; hidalgos, who came from the old country to win laurels; … wild tribes of the natives from all parts of the country, who had been sworn enemies from their cradles, and who had met only to cut one another's throats, and to procure victims for sacrifice; men, in short, differing in race, in language, and in interests, with scarcely anything in common among them.

""In the days of a great struggle against a foreign enemy who has been endeavoring for three years to enslave our country, it pleased God to send Russia a further painful trial. Internal troubles threatened to have a fatal effect on the further progress of this obstinate war. The destinies of Russia, the honor of her heroic Army, the happiness of the people, and the whole future of our beloved country demand that the war should be conducted at all costs to a victorious end.
The cruel enemy is making his last efforts and the moment is near when our valiant Army, in concert with our glorious Allies, will finally overthrow the enemy. In these decisive days in the life of Russia we have thought that we owed to our people the close union and organization of all its forces for the realization of a rapid victory; for which reason, in agreement with the Imperial Duma, we have recognized that it is for the good of the country that we should abdicate the Crown of the Russian State and lay down the Supreme Power.""

If we seize power today, we seize it not in opposition to the Soviets but on their behalf. The seizure of power is the business of the uprising; its political purpose will become clear after the seizure….
It would be an infinite crime on the part of the revolutionaries were they to let the chance slip, knowing that the salvation of the revolution, the offer of peace, the salvation of Petrograd, salvation from famine, the transfer of the land to the peasants depend upon them.

In this case, we have a future cash flow of $10, a discount rate of 9%, and a time period of 2 years. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

192,"On November 1, Beeson contracted to purchase from Sloan for $250,000 certain property located in the City of La Mirada. In the contract of sale, Beeson and Sloan agreed that the property was to be used for the purpose of building a commercial shopping mall. The contract required Beeson to pay Sloan a deposit of $12,500, with the balance of the purchase price payable at closing a month later on December 1. On November 24, the city council rezoned the property so that it could be used only for single-family residential purposes. As a consequence, Beeson refused to honor the contract. Sloan now brings an action for specific performance arguing that the doctrine of equitable conversion places the loss on the buyer. Beeson argues that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him. If judgment is for Beeson, it will most likely be because
A) Sloan assumed the risk.
B) Sloan would be unjustly enriched.
C) legal title remained in Sloan.

This means that the loss falls on the buyer (Beeson) in the event that the property is destroyed or damaged before closing, even if the buyer is not at fault. In this case, the property was not damaged, but its value was diminished due to the change in zoning. While it may be harsh and oppressive to enforce the contract on Beeson, the doctrine of equitable conversion dictates that the loss falls on him.

Final Answer = (D)
The doctrine of equitable conversion places the risk of loss on the buyer once the contract is signed, even if legal title has not yet passed. Thus, Beeson bears the loss here. The fact that the city council rezoned the property does not relieve Beeson of his obligation to purchase the property. The contract is still valid and enforceable.

Final Answer = (D)
Under the doctrine of equitable conversion, the buyer of real estate is treated as the equitable owner from the date of the contract of sale, even though legal title has not yet passed. As a result, the risk of loss or damage to the property passes to the buyer at that time. In this case, the city council's rezoning of the property after the contract of sale was signed placed the risk of loss on Beeson, the buyer. Therefore, Sloan is entitled to specific performance, and Beeson's argument that to enforce the contract would be harsh and oppressive to him is not likely to succeed.

193,"Over the last several years, the economy of a state has substantially changed. The state's economy used to be based solely on heavy industry. However, the state legislature approved legalized gambling within the state. As a consequence, many casinos and new hotels were built and the state's economy boomed. These moves were often induced by the granting by the state of special tax benefits for the construction of new casinos and hotels under state statutes. Recently, however, neighboring states have legalized gambling and offered greater tax incentives to the gaming industry. As a result, many of the casino and hotel owners have begun to leave the state. The unemployment and social welfare benefits the state has had to pay have substantially increased, burdening the remaining casinos, and also making it difficult for the state to lower its taxes to remain competitive with other states. On account of this predicament, the state legislature passed, and the governor duly signed, an emergency bill into law. According to the statute, the state imposed a one cent tax on the playing of any slot machine in any gambling casino. Since virtually all the slot machines required a payment of either a dime, quarter, or dollar, the imposition of this tax required a major costly adaptation on each slot machine to allow for the deposit of the additional one cent tax. Although many casino owners have complained about the tax, their only alternative is to absorb the tax themselves and lose one cent per game. As a consequence of the tax, fewer slot machines are purchased in the state by the casino owners. No manufacturer of slot machines is located in the state. Which of the following constitutional provisions provide the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill?
A) The commerce clause.
B) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
C) The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
D) The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.

The tax on slot machines would increase the cost of doing business for casinos, which could lead to higher prices for consumers and a decrease in interstate travel to the state. Therefore, the commerce clause provides the strongest ground to attack the validity of the state tax bill.

Final Answer = (A)
The state tax bill imposes a disproportionate burden on the slot machine industry by requiring costly adaptations to existing machines and discouraging the purchase of new ones. This burden is not shared by other industries within the state. As such, it is most likely to be successfully challenged under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits states from denying any person within their jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
Final Answer = (B)
The tax imposed by the state is likely to discriminate against out-of-state slot machine manufacturers by making it more expensive for them to sell their machines in the state. This discrimination could violate the Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from enacting laws that discriminate against interstate commerce.

**Step 1: Understand the symptoms.**

The patient developed shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema shortly after receiving the flu vaccine. These are symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction, which is a severe allergic reaction.

**Step 2: Consider the possible causes of an anaphylactic reaction to the flu vaccine.**

One of the most common causes of an anaphylactic reaction to the flu vaccine is an allergy to eggs. The flu vaccine is made using chicken eggs, so people who have an egg allergy may have an allergic reaction to the vaccine.

**Step 3: Identify the intervention that would have been most effective in preventing this reaction.**

The most effective way to prevent an anaphylactic reaction to the flu vaccine is to inquire about an egg allergy before administering the vaccine. If the patient had an egg allergy, the physician could have chosen a different type of flu vaccine that is not made using eggs.

**Final Answer = (A)**
**Inquiry about an egg allergy** is the most likely measure to have prevented this reaction. Influenza vaccine is grown in eggs and people with an egg allergy may experience an anaphylactic reaction.
